            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But if this charge be made out againſt him, doubtleſs your grace will neither protect, nor pitty a Friar (though ſeuerely diſciplin'd) for impoſing vpon Chriſtians (vnder the notion of Allegiance) Tenents in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with loyalty, or Monarchical gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>That your Grace forgaue him his former faults (in particular that great one of printing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40690:4"/>and preaching againſt the peace of <hi>46.</hi> and the royal authority, wherwith you were then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſted) is an argument of your Chriſtianity, and a performance of one article of that peace; That you afterwards made vſe of him (for reaſons of ſtate) notwithſtanding the experience you had of his treaſons, sheweth your wiſdom, but is no proof of his honeſty. As it would be great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in me to examin why a miniſter of ſtate did employ ſuch a Friar ſo I hope it is no want of reſpect to your Grace to let you and the world ſee, that his late principles are as treaſona<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble as his practiſes; and ſeing its very ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in ſtateſmen to punish the crimes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors, when they are no more vſefull, I may rationaly conclude your Grace will not commend or reward Peter Walsh for publishing a book ſtufft with errors, no leſs dangerous to the ſtate, then damnable to the ſoul.</p>
            <p>My Lord, Peter Walsh his conduct and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors haue rendred him ſo ridiculous and odious, that he can not be any more vſefull to your Grace or to the gouernment. And though he ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauors by nonſenſical Pamphlets to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be thought a fit inſtrument to promote the Proteſtant Reformation, inculcating (among other abſurdities) that the Roman Catholik Church of theſe laſt <hi>600.</hi> yeares hath erred no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly in the doctrin of loyalty due to tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Soueraigns, and that all the Bishops therof

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40690:6"/>bin ſcribling and printing of libels, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the world with an od kind of raw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted hereſies, ſtoln from the worſt of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, but ſo vnconnected, and abſurdly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by his dull pen, that though you may ſee he hath read ſom bookes, yet you will eaſily perceiue he vnderſtood very few; and ſuch as he vnderſtood, he wreſted to a wrong ſenſe. No meruail therfore if his notions be falſe, his diſcourſes conſuſe, his arguments weake, and his contradictions ſo frequent, that to confute him, you need go no further than his own writings. He is ſo tranſported with paſſion againſt the Church of Rome, and thoſe two great pillars therof <hi>Belarmin,</hi> and <hi>Baronius,</hi> that he treats and terms them no better than men hired by the Roman Court to Sacrifice all the world to the Popes ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The rage he is in for not finding out arguments to make this, and his other calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies credible, is ſo extraordinary, that he forgets what he ſaid in the foregoing page, or line, and through his whole work neuer remembers to ſpeake conſequently in any one particular. But to the end you may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinc't I do not iniure him, I will inſtance (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in this Preface) one or two of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions in the very main point he pretends to proue, and cleer moſt exactly, as being that wherupon he grounds his new religion.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:40690:7"/>
            <p>One of his chief errors is,
<note n="*" place="bottom">Peter Walsh in his Hiſtory and Vind. pag. 417 in fine.</note> 
               <hi>That ſupreme ſecular Princes neither could nor can grant any exemption from their own ſupreme ciuil coerciue power, to the Clergy or Clerks their ſubiects, liuing within their Dominions, and remaining ſubiects to them, becauſe this forſooth, implies a plain contradiction.</hi> Vpon this <hi>paradox</hi> he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes a new Church, or Reformation, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs not to draw Princes from their own, and their Anceſtors piety, by inculcating to them, it is an eſſential part of their temporal ſoueraignty and Prerogatiue to haue a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſupremacy, but ſo abſurdly limited, that he thinks it their greateſt ſecurity, to haue their hands tyed (by the law of nature, and Gods word) from honouring the Diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and his Church, with an exemption to its Miniſters from ſupreme ſecular Courts. He is oppoſed in this fooliſh <hi>Tenet</hi> both by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants and Catholiks; for we all agree in this, that God can not (at leaſt did not) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand temporal Soueraigns, not to oblige and honor (for his ſake) the ſpiritual Miniſtery by exempting them from the ſupreme coerciue power of the ſecular magiſtrat; ſeing that for the peace of the commonwealth, the ſafety of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and puniſhment of Malefactors, it is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſufficient, that delinquent Clergymen be proceeded againſt by eccleſiaſtical Iudges.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:40690:7"/>
            <p>Let vs now ſee how palpably he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts himſelf, and wearies his Reader in this abſurd and fundamental <hi>Theſis</hi> of his vaſt vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, and new Religion. Euery Catholik as well as himſelf obiects againſt it the Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Miracles of S. Thomas of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury; it being euident out of all Hiſtories, both ſacred and profane; that S. Thomas ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd, was canoniſed and declared a Martyr, for defending the immunities of the Church, and particularly that of Churchmen from the coerciue ſupreme power of ſecular Courts. The Friar grants S. Thomas his Sanctity, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and Martyrdom, but ſayes he ſufferd, and God wrought all thoſe Miracles, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did or could in conſcience pretend that Church men were exempted from the ſupreme coerciue power of the Secular Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat, but becauſe he maintaind the temporal and municipal lawes of England then in force, by which, Clerks or Churchmen were ſo exempted from the ſecular ſupreme Courts. Heer is one contradiction. If there were mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal lawes in force then in England, which warranted S. Thomas his proceedings for the immunity of the Church and Clergymen from the Kings ſupreme ſecular coerciue power, or Courts, and Churchmen had a true right to thoſe exemptions (as Friar <hi>Walsh</hi> confeſſeth from page 414. to page 418. of his Hiſtory
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40690:8"/>(quoting the lawes themſelues) how can he without contradiction ſay, that Princes and Parliaments did not, nay could not make ſuch lawes, or grant ſuch exemptions to Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. How can he pretend ſuch immunities or exemptions are contrary to the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the word of God?</p>
            <p>He ſolues this difficulty with an other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. For, after granting there were ſuch lawes exempting Churchmen, made by the Kings and Parliaments, he ſayes (pag. 422.) that S. Thomas at the inſtance, and with the concurrence of all the other Biſhops, condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to the Repeal of thoſe temporal lawes, which fauored the Clergy's exemption. But then how was he a Saint, or Martyr for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the lawes that had bin repeald? The anſwer to this is at hand ſaith <hi>Walsh,</hi> very facil and cleer. S. Thomas (ſaith he in the ſame page 422.) though he ſwore to conſent to the repeal of the lawes exempting the Clergy from the ſupreme coerciue power, yet <hi>Swearing alone was not enough, without further ſigning and ſealing, as it ſeems the cuſtom then was of the Bishops and Peers in making of lawes; nor all three together, without a free conſent in thoſe, or of thoſe who ſwore ſo, or ſign'd and ſeal'd ſo; and that there was no free conſent, but a forc't one, by threats of impriſonment, banishment, death, appears &amp;c.</hi> This anſwer may paſs,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40690:8"/>if it be true; but immediatly he confeſſeth its not credible that the ſubſtance and validity of a law, ſhould depend vpon ſuch formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and indiuidual circumſtances of euery particular man, ſeing the maior vote in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament made the law. For, after that he had maintain'd poſitiuely in twelue pages the aforeſaid anſwer, he ſudenly falls off from it in the 434. of his tedious volum, and ſayes. <hi>Jt is not ſo cleer in all reſpects that thoſe</hi> 16 <hi>heads of cuſtoms</hi> (which S. Thomas oppoſed as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the immunities of the Church) <hi>paſſed not legaly, and before the Saints death, into a juſt municipal law of the land, or of England. For it may be ſaid firſt, and ſaid alſo vpon very probable grounds out of the ſeueral Hiſtorians, who writ of purpoſe of thoſe dayes and matters, that they all</hi> (Biſhops) <hi>freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. And ſecondly it may be ſaid, that the greater vote enacts a law in Parliament, hauing the conſent Roial, whether one Bishop, or more, or euen all the Bishops diſſent. And thirdly yet it may be ſaid, that all lawes moſt commonly, or at leaſt too often may be call'd in queſtion vpon that ground of feare of the Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding this third or fourth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, and recantation of his anſwer, building Saint Thomas of Canterbury's Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity vpon his ſuffering for maintaining the temporal lawes of the land in fauor of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40690:9"/>Clergy's immunities, notwithſtanding, I ſay, he confeſſes there were no ſuch temporal lawes then in England, (becauſe they had bin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd by Acts of Parliament, with concurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of Saint Thomas himſelf, and the other Biſhops) yet he aduiſes his Readers (pag 435.) to fix rather vpon this anſwer, (both contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted and adhered to by himſelf) than on the others, no leſs abſurd, which he giues. By this you may gueſs how ſolidly grounded his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is.</p>
            <p>But then he ſupplyes the fifth contradiction and weakeneſs of all his Anſwers, by a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and acute general rule, which he ſets down in the beginning of the page 435. in theſe words. <hi>Sixt and laſt reaſon. That we muſt rather giue any Anſwer, that inuolues not hereſy or manifeſt error in the Catholik ſaith, or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reaſon obuious to euery man, than allow or iustify the particular actions or conteſts, or doctrine of any one Bishop or Pope, how great or holy ſoeuer otherwiſe; or euen of many ſuch, or of all their Partakers in ſuch, againſt both holy ſcripture, plain enough in the caſe &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſure, if well applyed, I confeſs may iuſtify this very abſurd anſwer but me thinks anſwers which inuolue contradictions, ought not to be comprehended in that vniuerſal <hi>(any anſwer)</hi> which may be giuen to ſuch preſſing arguments againſt the Friars new Religion, as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40690:9"/>this of S. Thomas his Martyrdom, ſanctity and Miracles. For, though an anſwer did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolue hereſy or manifeſt error in the Catholik faith, yet if it inuolues nonſenſe, or a plain contradiction, it inuolues an error againſt natural reaſon obuious to euery man, (except <hi>Peter Walsh</hi>) and therfore it ought not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a good anſwer; its much better (in my opinion) to allow or iuſtify the particular actions or conteſts, or doctrin of one holy and learned Biſhop, or Pope, and of all their partakers, which in our caſe is the whole Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholik Church, euer ſince S. Thomas his Martyrdom) then the fancies of a dull ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Friar, that contradicts his own an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers ſo frequently; a Friar that ran mad for not obtaining a Biſhoprik; for which he ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed in the yeare 1646. the loyalty due to his King, the reſpect due to his Lieutenant, and the loue due to his Countrey, which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolued in Bloud by printing and preaching againſt the gouernment, againſt a very aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious peace, againſt the publik faith and the obligation of maintaining it.</p>
            <p>As for his maintaining the miracles and ſanctity of S. Thomas of Canterbury, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not either from deuotion to the Saint, or any reuerence he hath for the doctrin or practiſe of the Catholik Church (of theſe laſt 600. years) ſeing he ſayes it hath maintain'd
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40690:10"/>and practiſed ſince Gregory 7. thoſe enormous errors, which he now would fain reform; and by conſequence, its honouring S. Thomas for a Saint, may be alſo an error in his opinion. How then coms the Friar to be ſo deuout to S. Thomas, as to ſay he was no Traitor. You muſt know, great part of his deſign in writing this vaſt volum, was, to make his Court to my Lord Duke of Ormond, whoſe family owes and ownes its great Eſtate in Jreland to the ſcruple King Henry 2. had for perſecuting the Saint and his relations, wherof one of the neereſt was my Lord Duke of Ormonds An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor; to whom King Henry 2. gaue great priuileges and Lands in Jreland, to expiat what fault he had in the murther of ſo inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and holy a Prelat. But if <hi>Peter Walsh</hi> had knowen my Lord Duke of Ormond as well as his neereſt Relations do, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer contradict himſelf ſo manifeſtly and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently for making Thomas Becket a Saint out of a complement to my Lord Duke, whoſe iuſtice and integrity is ſo eminent, that his fauor is not to be gain'd by courting him in his relations; as diuers noblemen and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men can witneſs, who in hopes of being reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tored to their Eſtates by marrying his Neeces, got nothing by the bargain, but the honor of being allyed to ſo illuſtrious a family. So that You ſee Friar <hi>Walsh</hi> is as much miſtaken in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40690:10"/>his Courtſhip, as in his doctrin.</p>
            <p>Many perhaps will iudge theſe my Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maduerſions ſuperfluous, 1. becauſe Friar <hi>Walsh</hi> his book ſufficiently declares its own abſurdities. 2. Its bulk is ſo great, the ſtile ſo vnpoliſh't, the <hi>parentheſis</hi> of his own praiſes ſo long, ſo falſe, and ſo impertinent, that few will trouble themſelues with reading a Hiſtory ſo litle importing the publik, ſo iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to particular perſons, and ſo falſe, ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, and tedious in itſelf. But becauſe <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Walsh</hi> is a likely man to fancy that others take as much pleaſure in reading his book, as himſelf doth, I ſhall endeauor to diſabuſe him, and do the publik that ſeruice, as to put this vain Friar out of conceit with himſelf and his work. If this may be effected (which I confeſs is very difficult) it will be a great eaſe to the publik and to the Preſs, which he threatens with a ſecond Tome of the ſame dull dirty ſtuff. Jadmire more the patience of many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and witty men, which this pittifull Friar hath endeuored to diſgrace with lyes, than I do the applauded works, which ſom of them haue printed to aſſert the truth of Faith. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they do not think him worth their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing. Though I am not particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, yet ſeing his book hath ſo much barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous railing, and heretical nonſenſe, that it is a <hi>nuiſance</hi> to ciuility as well as to Chriſtianity,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40690:11"/>I will ſhake his fundamental principles, to the end the world may not be further abuſed by them, nor by the ſtories of a virulent pen, that vents nothing but hereſies againſt the Church, rebellion againſt Soueraigns, enuy againſt his ſuperiors, malice againſt his equals, calumnies againſt his aduerſaries, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of himſelf.</p>

That the Oath of Supremacy hath bin raſhly and obſtinatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, oppoſed, and traduced by Roman Catholiks; becauſe it attributes to the King only ciuil authority and power, and denies to the Pope no ſpiritual or Eccleſiaſtical, ſaue only that which the two general Councells of Epheſus, and Calcedon, as alſo that of Afrik of 217 Biſhops (whereof S. Auguſtin was one) denied to the Biſhops of Rome. 2. That the Popes and Biſhops of the Roman Catholik Church for theſe laſt 600. years, haue taught and practiſed enormous principles, which godly men haue continualy cried down, as wicked, impious, heretical and tyrannical: and that the vſual Oath (which all Catholik Biſhops haue taken at their conſecration for many hundred years) is not conſiſtent with the loyalty all Chriſtians owe to their temporal Soueraigns.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE beſt way to decide this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſy, is to ſet down the words of the Oath, which are.</p>
               <p>I. A.

               <p>Mr. Walſh, giue me leaue to aſk you, whether you euer read this Oath, and if you did, whether you are ſure you vnderſtand Engliſh, or whether better than Engliſh-men do? for, the common opinion is, that euery nation vnderſtands its own language better than ſtrangers. Mr. Walſh, all Engliſhmen vnderſtand by the word <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> a quite different thing from <hi>temporal,</hi> as you may ſee in <hi>Thomas Thomaſius</hi> his Dictionary. If this be ſo, I feare you will hardly perſuade Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that they do not vnderſtand engliſh, at leaſt as
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40690:15"/>well as you, or any other Iriſh man. Now to the point. Doth not the Oath in cleer terms auerre, that the King is the <hi>only</hi> ſupreme Gouernor of England, and of all other his Dominions, as well in all <hi>Spiritual or Eccleſiaſtical things or cauſes,</hi> as temporal? Is <hi>temporal</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual</hi> the ſame? or do theſe words ſignify the ſame? Jf not, how can you proue or pretend that no <hi>ſpiritual</hi> authority, or power is giuen the King, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the Pope by this Oath of Supremacy? I pray obſerue; if the King be the <hi>only</hi> ſupream Gouernor of his Dominions in <hi>all ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> cauſes or things, hath he not <hi>all</hi> the ſpiritual power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in his own Dominions? And if the Pope be a <hi>ſorrain Prince, Perſon, or Prelate,</hi> and no forrain Prince Perſon, or Prelate hath, or <hi>ought</hi> to haue, <hi>any Eccleſiaſtical</hi> or <hi>ſpiritual iuriſdiction,</hi> power, Superiority, prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, or authority within his Majeſties Kingdomes, how can the Pope haue any ſpiritual power or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the ſame?</p>
               <p>J doubt very much, whether your marginal note directing to I know not what <hi>admonition after the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctions of
<note n="*" place="bottom">Pag. 16. of his Dedicatory to the Catholiks.</note> Q. Elizabeth, and vpon the</hi> 37. <hi>article of the Church of England</hi> will bring you or the oath off ſo cleerly as you fancy. By that Admonition after the iniunctions of Q. Elizabeth, is pretended, the Church of England did not attribute to the Queen, power to exerciſe any ſpiritual function, as that of conſecrating Prieſts, and Biſhops, or miniſtring the Sacraments. Suppoſe this interpretation (which came, I muſt tell you, ſom what too late) were not known to be a pittifull shift, to ſtop the mouthes of thoſe who laught at the weakneſs of the Bishops in allowing, and at the vanity of the Queen in aſſuming the ſpiritual ſupremacy of the Church; ſuppoſe, I ſay, the Queen
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40690:15"/>could not ordain Prieſts and Bishops, becauſe herſelf was neither Prieſt nor Bishop; doth that hinder from hauing in herſelf, and giuing to others ſpiritual iurif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to ordain and miniſter the Sacraments? what think you of lay Princes, and perſons, that are Bishops elect? Haue they not ſpiritual iuriſdiction, and can they not giue it to others? Though Q. Elizabeth was incapable of ſuch ſpiritual iuriſdiction, becauſe she was a woman, yet her ſucceſſors can not be excepted againſt vpon that ſcore. But ſpeak ſeriouſly, Mr. Walsh, do you think it was in the power of thoſe, who explain'd the Oath of ſupremacy (if any did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it) to alter the common known ſignification of words, and giue them a quite contrary, in matters of religion, Sacraments, and Oaths? If it were, there would be no religion in the world, no Faith, either human or Diuine. How could you therfore imagin, the <hi>Conuocation,</hi> or euen the Parliament of England, did or can alter the ſignification of words in an Oath, wherin a man profeſſeth his Religion, or an important point therof? Can any power vpon earth declare this form of baptiſm, valid; <hi>I Baptiſe thee in the name of the mother and ſiſter, and Brother,</hi> by pretending forſooth, that by an Admonition of the <hi>Conuocation,</hi> or any earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly authority, the word <hi>Mother</hi> ſignifies <hi>Father; ſiſter ſon; Brother Holy Ghoſt?</hi> Do you fancy, Mr. Walsh, that any iudicious proteſtant, or any Parliament man in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, will belieue you, if you should tell him, that his child is well-baptis'd by ſuch a form, and expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?</p>
               <p>Jf you wil read the Statuts 1. Eliz. 1. &amp; 8. Eliz 1. You will find that the Kings of Englands ſupremacy, is ſo ſpiritual and ſublime, that there needs no chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſignification of the word <hi>ſpiritual</hi> into <hi>temporal,</hi> and that a King of England (if he should think fit)

That the Kings of England may giue by their letters patents power to any of their lay ſubiects to conſecrat Bishops and Prieſts, is very cleer in the aforeſaid ſtatuts. For, by two of them, <hi>there is giuen to the Queen's Highneſs, her Heirs, and Succeſsors &amp;c. full power and authority by letters patents vnder the great ſeal of England, from time to time to aſsigne, name and authoriſe ſuch perſon or perſons at she and they shall think meet and conuenient, to exerciſe, vſe, enjoy, and execute vnder her Highneſs all manner of iuriſdictions, priuileges, preheminences, and authorities, in any wiſe touching or concerning any ſpiritual or Eccleſiaſtical power, or iuriſdiction, within this Realm, or any other her Majeſties Dominions or Countreyes.</hi> Now <hi>Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood</hi> being nothing but a ſpiritual power to conſecrat Chriſt's body and bloud, and forgiue ſins; and <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi> including beſides the ſame, a ſpiritual power to conſecrat and ordain Prieſts and Bishops, who can doubt but that by vertue of theſe words and Statuts, the Queen might, and her ſucceſſors may, by their letters patents and great ſeal, giue power to any of their lay ſubiects to make a proteſtant Bishop or Prieſt; ſeing by thoſe letters patents <hi>any perſon</hi> that is a ſubiect, receiueth full power to <hi>exerciſe, vſe, execute, enioy &amp;c.</hi> all manner of iuriſdictions, preheminences, and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in any wiſe touching or concerning any ſpiritual or Eccleſiaſtical power, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This is no vain ſpeculation Mr. Walsh, but a known practiſe grounded vpon the 25. article of 39. of the english Proteſtant Religion: it being declared therby, that no <hi>viſible</hi> ſign or <hi>ceremony</hi> (and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40690:16"/>no impoſition of Epiſcopal hands) hath bin <hi>ordain'd of God for any</hi> of theſe fiue commonly call'd <hi>Sacraments,</hi> wherof holy Orders or Epiſcopal conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is one. And therfore its no meruail the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment declared 8. Eliz. 1. that the firſt proteſtant Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops were &amp; should be true Bishops, though it could not be proued that any Bishops euer laid hands vpon them. The Story is known. In the beginning of Q. Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths reign it was queſtioned, whether the Proteſtant Bishops were true or real Bishops; the Catholik Bishops who refuſed to conſecrat any of them, maintain'd, they were not, becauſe they had not any proteſtant, who was a true Bishop to conſecrat them, hauing nothing to shew for the Epiſcopal caracter but the Queens let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters parents; and therfore the Catholik writers prouokt them (in print) to name the Bishop, who ordain'd or conſecrated them (as themſelues pretended) but fiue or ſix years before. This appears in
<note n="*" place="bottom">D Stapleton in his Counter blaſt againſt Horn fol. 79. &amp; 301. and in his return of vntruths gaianſt Iewel, fol. 130.</note> D. <hi>Stapleton,</hi> Dr. <hi>Harding,</hi> and other bookes againſt <hi>Iewel</hi> edit 1565. &amp; 1563. fol. 57. &amp; 59. All the world perceiuing at that time, how none of the two proteſtant writers, who vndertook to anſwer, (<hi>Iewel</hi> and <hi>Horn</hi>) could name any, that conſecrated <hi>Parker</hi> (of whoſe conſecration depended that of all the reſt) nor produce any Regiſters therof (as <hi>Harding</hi> in expreſs terms demanded) it was thought neceſſary (for ſupplying this shamefull ſilence, and repreſſing the inſolency of the popish Aduerſaries) to declare the ground wherupon the proteſtants claim'd to be true Bishops, and to be both legaly and validly conſecrated. Then was made the Statut 8. Elizab. 1. which begins, <hi>Foraſmuch as diuers queſtions by ouermuch boldneſs of ſpeech and talk — hath lately grown vpon the making and conſecrating of Archbishops and Bishops within
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40690:17"/>this Realm &amp;c.</hi> And though D.

The Statuts words are very cleer, ſo are thoſe of the Catholik writers, whoſe deſign was not to proue, that <hi>Parker, Iewel, Horn &amp;c.</hi> were not proteſtant Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops; but that they were not true Bishops, or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops at all. They knew very well that they were legal proteſtant Bishops, becauſe they knew they had the Queens letters patents iſſued forth to <hi>the perſon or perſons;</hi> whether Bishops or not, that matters nothing, as cleerly appears in the Statuts 1. Eliz. 1. and 8. Eliz. 1. And therfore D. <hi>Harding</hi> tells <hi>Iewel,</hi> he doubts not but that he may shew him the Queens letters patents for his Epiſcopacy; and by conſequence that he was a proteſtant Bishop; adding withall, that he was no true Bishop; becauſe (ſayes he) the Queen may giue the lands, but not the caracter of a Bishop.</p>
               <p>To proue then that they were both legaly and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidly proteſtant Bishops, the Parliament (inſiſting vpon the pureſt proteſtant principles) thought it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to declare, and make out that they were conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated by virtue of the Queens letters patents, and by ſom of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The making of Biſhops, and giuing them ſpiritual iuriſdiction only by the Kings letters patents, was the primitiue doctrin and ſpirit of the english Reformation, as appears by an Act of Parliament an. 1. Eduard. 6. entituled, <hi>an Act for the election of Bishops, and what ſcales and ſtiles they, and other ſpiritual perſons, exerciſing iuriſdiction Eccleſiaſtical, shall vſe.</hi> In which Act (ſaith D.

I am ſure it ownes none in the Biſhops, bur that which they receiue from his Majeſty; and themſelues own it in their Act or Oath of homage, <hi>that they receiue all their iuriſdiction, as well ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and eccleſiaſtical, as temporal, wholy</hi> and <hi>ſolely</hi> from the King.

How came you then to act (as their Procurator) quite contrary to this, and to your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion? Realy Mr. Walſh, if this be true, you are wors than the buiſy Monks of Epheſus. At leaſt you are very vnfortunat in your allegations of Councells: they alwayes ſeem to make againſt yourſelf. You bring againſt the Popes ſpiritual ſupremacy the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Emperor <hi>Martianus,</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Anatolius,</hi> and make the 28. Canon of the Councel of Calcedon the ground of your obiection; wheras you know in your conſcience (if you know or read any thing) that there are admitted but 27. Canons of the Councell of Calcedon; and <hi>Theodoret,</hi> who was preſent at it, teſtifieth there were no more; the clandeſtin Decree, which <hi>Anatolius</hi> and ſom Greeks made and foiſted into the Canons, is reiected as ridiculous, and forged; as you may ſee at large in learned Cardinal <hi>Perons</hi> anſwer to King Iames lib. 1. cap. 34.2. That though the 28. were admitted as a genuine Canon, yet what is that to your purpoſe, againſt the Bishop of Rome his ſpiritual ſupremacy? That 28. Canon pretends only preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Conſtantinople before Alexandria; not before Rome.</p>
               <p>But its much to my purpoſe (and I hope it will be for your profit) to mind you how the Emperor <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus,</hi> after that the Catholik Faith had bin confirm'd by the Biſhops ſubſcriptions, did propoſe ſomthings in fauor therof to the Fathers; thinking it decent (ſaith he) to haue them rather form'd or regularly framed,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40690:19"/>by their Decree, than by his own Imperial law. And the firſt point of the intended Reformation was, that to hinder hereſies and the diſorders of irregular Monks, which of late had ſo diſturbed and infected the Church of God, it might be decreed, that they ſhould be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the Biſhops, and not medle with Eccleſiaſtical or ciuil affairs, but ſerue God, and keep within their Monaſteries. Well Mr. Walſh, I ſee, let your friends do all they can to excuſe or extenuate your faults, you are reſolued to lay yourſelf and them open to your Aduerſaries. Did not I but iuſt now aduiſe you, as your beſt friend, not to medle with eccleſiaſtical affairs, which are aboue your capacity, and learning; eſpecialy theſe general Councells? You ſee what this of Calce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and the Emperor <hi>Martianus</hi> think of irregular reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men, and how the generality of people take you to be one of that kind, a diſturber of the peace of the Church, and a broacher of hereſies.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>R. Walſh, I couple theſe two inſtruments (the oath of Supremacy and your Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance) together, becauſe yourſelf makes no diſtinction between them, as to the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs of their being taken by Catholiks. For, though each of them ſeem to renounce the Popes ſpiritual au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<note n="a" place="bottom">Pag. 24. 1. part.</note> yet you tell vs, there is no ſuch matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Spiritual authority</hi> in thoſe oathes Formularies, ſignifies not <hi>Spiritual,</hi> but <hi>temporal</hi> authority. Seing therfore you are of opinion, that the oath of ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy may be taken with a good conſcience by Roman Catholiks, and that the whole Roman Catholik Church belieues, and tells vs the contrary, you haue no reaſon to be angry with Catholiks, if they do not rely vpon your word in any point that concerns their conſcience or religion: and though your Remonſtrance had no other fault, but that it is placed by you in the ſame line and predicament (as to the lawfulneſs of taking it) with the oath of Suprecacy, Catholiks are bound to refuſe it; neither can a Franciſcan Friar, who reproaches Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholiks with <hi>rashneſs</hi> and <hi>obſtinacy</hi> for not taking the oath of Supremacy, expect to be their Spiritual Director, but rather to be concluded by them an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtat; and muſt not take ill, if his writings ſhould be reiected and burnt as heretical.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:40690:21"/>
               <p>Seing therfore Mr. Walſh, your arguments preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to proue that the two general Councells of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Calcedon,</hi> as well as the Prouincial of Afrik, taught the doctrin which Roman Catholiks except againſt in the oath of Supremacy, are found to be miſtakes; what other arguments do you produce to conuince Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks of raſhneſs and obſtinancy for not taking that oath? None but your own authority; nothing but your ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Roman Catholik Church hath err'd ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shly and obſtinatly for theſe 600. laſt years, becauſe it admitted not a Spiritual Supremacy in temporal Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigns. Realy Mr. Walſh, I do not belieue your ſole authority is a ſufficient argument to proue the Church hath erred. To proue ſo raſh an aſſertion you would fain make us miſtruſt the teſtimonies of holy and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Authors of the Church Hiſtory, as <hi>Baronius, Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> and others; They are Impoſtors, you ſay, hired by the Court of Rome to diueſt Emperors and Kings of their right of gouerning ſpiritual and eccleſiaſtical affairs; and to place it in the Pope. Your words (page 40. to the Reader) are, <hi>If the truth were known it would be found that Baronius, and the reſt fallowing him were willing to make vſe of any malitious vngrounded fictions whatſoeuer againſt luſtinian the Emperor.</hi>—This Juſtinian was in the later end of his dayes, an heretik; and took vpon him to make lawes in matters of Faith; but he dyed ſudenly before he could publish them. Yet before he was an heretik, he made good Edicts in fauor of the true Faith; and for this he is commended by Popes and Councells, as a Catholik; as alſo becauſe its ſayd he was reconcil'd at his death. Now you, Mr. Walsh, ſay, that the ancient and modern writers knew well enough he was neuer an heretik, but that they diffame him as an heretik, becauſe <hi>his laws in Eccleſiaſtical matters, euen thoſe of Faith, are a perpetual eyſore to them, becauſe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40690:22"/>theſe laws are a precedent to all other good Princes to gouern their own reſpectiue Churches in the like manner without any regard, of Bulla Caenae, or of ſo many other vain allegations of thoſe men; that would make the world belieue it vnlawfull for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Princes to make eccleſiaſtical lawes by their own ſole au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truly Mr. Walſh, I haue endeuored to know the truth of thoſe two Cardinals, <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and <hi>Baronius;</hi> and do find, they were both, holy humble men, ſo farr from being hir'd by the Court of Rome, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them could be perſuaded by it to accept of more for their maintenance, than what was abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for their dignity. They liued and dyed in the liſt of the poor Cardinals; both were named Cardinalls againſt their will: both induſtriouſly ſought to make themſelues vncapable of the Popedom. Twenty dayes did Baronius reſiſt in the Conclaue the offers and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of the Cardinals his friends, who were able and reſolued to make him Pope, vntill at length he perſuaded them to chooſe Leo 11. Both theſe Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals virtues are ſo conſpicuous, that many preſs for their Canonization, and its belieued it will be obtain'd, God working Miracles to teſtify that they deſerue it. This is the truth, Mr. Walſh, and the world blames you very much for calling ſuch men Hirelings, Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors &amp;c. What ſhall your friends ſay to excuſe you when they heare you call'd an ignorant ſpitefull heretik, for calumniating ſuch holy men as theſe? Som who obſerue your actions, ſay, you are hired to write theſe calumnies, and that you haue choſen rather ſo baſe and mercenary a way to damn your ſelf and others, than to liue quiet, and ſerue God in your Cell, according to your rule and profeſſion. Good God, Mr. Walsh; is this poſſible? Can you ſell your own ſoul and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Saints for ſuch paltrey ſtuff, and at ſo low
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40690:22"/>a rate as 200. per an. If this be true, you are vnhappy; but Gods mercy expects your repentance, for which we your friends can but pray.</p>
               <p>Others think you deſpair not by your litle bookes, and this great Volume to gain the fauor of temporal Soueraings. I can not belieue they will (by your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion) degenerat from the example of their renown'd Predeceſſors, and particularly from that of Conſtantin the great, who was ſo far from making laws for eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical matters or perſons, or medling with matters of Faith, that his ſaying and maxim was
<note n="a" place="bottom">Rufinus lib. 10. hiſt. cap. 2. S. Gregor. lib. 4. epiſt. 45.</note> (ſpeaking to the Bishops) <hi>Ves Dij eſtis a ſummo Deo conſtituti, aequum non eſt, vt homo iudicet Deos;</hi> I do not think I ſay Mr. Walsh, that Chriſtian Princes will degenerat from this example, (applauded by all the world when Chriſtianity was in its primitiue purity) to follow that of the Emperor <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> when he fell from the Faith of Chriſt. Would it not be rashneſs both in Soueraigns and Subiects to preferr your bare teſtimony (who are (to my griefe) reported to be the greateſt lyar and Impoſtor in the world) before the joint teſtimony of all orthodox wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the practiſe of the whole Roman Catholik Church, euer ſince it began to florish vnder Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin the great? Many except againſt your ſtile as well as againſt the matter: You excuſe (page 43. of your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face) <hi>the meanneſs, or rather ſadneſs of your ſtile all along your book, — you took no care (you ſay) of the language, though you took enough of the matter.</hi> In my opinion you are more faulty in the choice of your matter, than in your expreſſion of it. But you thought perhaps, the matter was ſo good, and neceſſary for the Saluation of ſouls, that you
<note n="b" place="bottom">Ibidem pag. 43.</note> 
                  <hi>enlarged often, and repeated the ſame things not ſeldom where you needed not, were your deſign to write only
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40690:23"/>for the learned, or thoſe of quick apprehenſion. But ſeing thoſe you intended chiefly to ſpeak vnto, were the Roman Catholik Clergy of Ireland, wherof very few are great Clerks, you choſe that manner of writing for their ſake, that the meaneſt of them might vnderſtand whateuer you would be at.</hi> I am ſory to heare this Mr. Walsh; will you diſgrace your own nation? One of them ſpoke thus to me of you. How comes none of the Roman Catholik Clergy of Ireland to haue as quick an apprehenſion, and as much learning, as Peter Walsh their Countreyman, and one who ſpent his time more idely than moſt of them? Is it becauſe his forwardneſs in promoting proteſtancy againſt his conſcience, and his importuning great men to be made an inſtrument of ſowing diſſention, and diuiding Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholiks by his Remonſtrance, hath gain'd him a litle credit and countenance in Court, therfore he muſt be ſo learned and loyal, as to teach not only the Irish Catholik Clergy, but the whole Catholik Church their duty (as if they were ignorant of it) to God and Ceſar? Whence had he all this learning? Did his tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching a yeare or two Philoſophy, and half a yeare, or therabouts Diuinity in Kilkenny, to half a dozen Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, make him an Oecumenical maſter, and adorn him with ſo extraordinary knowledge, both Diuine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as to inſtruct not only the dull Clergy of Ireland, but the acuteſt wits of France, Spain, and Italy? The man was ſo ſenſible of the aſperſion you caſt vpon his, and your own Countreymen, that I durſt not excuſe you; and indeed you ſpoke inconſideratly; for its well known to moſt of the famous Vniuerſities of Europe, that as Irish men haue bin antiently their firſt Founders, ſo they haue bin of late their chiefeſt Profeſſors and greateſt Ornament. Your ſelf might haue known, or at leaſt heard of Richard <hi>Wadding</hi> the Auguſtin in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimbria,</hi> of Iames <hi>Arthur</hi> the Dominican in <hi>Alcala, Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manca,</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:40690:23"/>and <hi>Conimbria;</hi> of <hi>Holiwood</hi> in Padua, and Muſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pont: of Luke <hi>Wadding</hi> and Richard <hi>Lynch</hi> in Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manca: of Peter <hi>wadding</hi> in Prague, all Jeſuits: of many famous Doctors of <hi>Sorbon</hi> in Paris: of your own Friars <hi>Hicky, Cauel, Lombard,</hi> and Luke <hi>Waddin,</hi> in Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. Of the Ieſuit Thomas <hi>Talbot</hi> (aliàs <hi>de Leon</hi>) in <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada,</hi> the Oracle of all Spain, not only for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundneſs in Diuinity, but alſo for the vaſt extent of his knowledge in other ſciences and languages. You might haue knowen the eminent Doctor of Bologna, Riredan of Toloſa, not to ſpeake of other famous Phyſitians, who though not Profeſſors, yet Practio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſo farr aboue the common ſort, as Fenell Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotty, O Meara &amp;c. That they may be recorded to poſterity for patterns of ſafe and ſucceſſfull preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as others are for printed bookes. Theſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, though all dead (the two laſt only excepted) yet are a fresh and euerlaſting euidence againſt your impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting dulneſs of apprehenſion, and ignorance, to the Irish Clergy, and nation. I could name (ſaid an other) four of the Irish Bishops, yet liuing, and many of the inferior Clergy (eſpecialy Regulars) who taught with great applauſe in foreign and famous Vniuerſities both Diuinity and Philoſophy. Without doubt they take ill that a petty friar should pretend to teach them their duty either to God or the King. Why did he not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute them in the Congregation of Dublin an. 1666. when he had the Lord Lieutenants fauor to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance his doctrin, and fright them into his opinions? Why did not he anſwer then the Prolocutor (Bishop <hi>Lynch</hi>) and Father Nicholas <hi>Netteruilles</hi> reaſons? Why did he not accept of Father Iohn <hi>Talbots</hi> offer, to shew, in diuers particulars, Frier <hi>Redmund Carons</hi> groſs inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable falſifications in his <hi>Remonſtrantia Hibernorum,</hi> and in his leſſer libel intituled <hi>Loyalty aſſerted?</hi> Why did he
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40690:24"/>not anſwer the obiections and reaſons of many others as learned men as theſe, who confounded him and his errors in that Congregation? Then was the time to vindicat his doctrin and Remonſtrance; but if now after 6. years ſtudy, <hi>Walsh</hi> his volum of that ſubiect is a <hi>nuiſance</hi> to the Academies, a bundell of errors rak't out of the ashes of burnt heretical bookes, how wat it poſſible for him to ſpeake then any thing but hereſies and nonſenſe? This your Countrey men. What could I anſwer to this?</p>
               <p>But 'tis wors yet. He gaue me the enſuing writing, wherin he vndertakes to shew, euen to yourſelf, that thoſe of the Irish Clergy you ſo much vndervalue, had, and haue ſtill the better of you, not only in wit, but in learning, euen in this controuerſy, after your 6. years ſtudy of this matter. Let vs firſt of all (ſaith he) ſtate it right. You pretend that the Supremacy of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Soueraings, doth not only giue them power to make eccleſiaſtical lawes, euen in matters of Faith (as appears by your foreſaid own words, ſpeaking of luſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian the Emperor) but that the ſpiritual authority of the Church, can not warrant its punishing by corporal penalties ſuch an irregular Friar as you are thought to be. And to make this your <hi>Tenet</hi> more plauſible, you would fain inferr from the coerciue power in the Church of whipping ſuch a fellow as you are, a coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciue power to dethrone Princes; as if forſooth they could not ſit ſecurely, nor be at eaſe in their thrones, if you should be diſciplin'd. Mr. Walsh the Soueraign<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty of Princes is ſo ſacred a thing, that I dare not medle with it, and am forbid to write of that ſubiect, as all others are; who liue in France; (the man is a Graduate of Sorbon.) But you know that Bellarmin himſelf confeſſeth, Princes can not be depoſed for bare hereſy, though Popes may. Their temporal iuriſdiction can
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40690:24"/>not be queſtion'd for their errors. How then can you inferr that if the Church may punish and whip you for hereſy, it may alſo depoſe Kings for the ſame? Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hope it may be diſcuſſed without conſequence or offence.</p>

Becauſe <hi>euery Ghoſtly Father may in ſom caſes enioyn his Penitent ſuch punishments; and by virtue of his meer ſpiritual power may do ſo; but can inflict none either by himſelf, or by an other, if the penitent will be refractory.

               </p>
               <p>Mr. Walsh, the dulneſs and ignorance which you imputed to the Irish Clergy, muſt be retorted vpon yourſelf in this diſpute. Are you ſo short ſighted, as not to diſcern the vaſt difference there is between the ſpiritual power of a ghoſtly Father <hi>in ſoro confeſsionali,</hi> (as you call it) and the ſpiritual power of a Bishop in his Dioceſs, or of your General in his Order, as they are Paſtors, and Iudges <hi>in foro externo?</hi> The one is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed and extended no further than to abſolue and punish priuatly a penitent, who is his own accuſer, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40690:25"/>coms with a perfect ſubmiſſion and reſignation to any penance or penalty the Confeſſor shall think fit to giue If the penitent coms not with this preparation, there is no power in the Confeſſor to abſolue him, or to giue him a penance. But the ſpiritual power, and authority of the Biſhops, and Generals of orders, as ſuch, is not only to abſolue priuarly one who ſubmits voluntarily, and confeſſeth his frailties and faults of his own accord; but to punish and correct publikly ſuch as will not ſubmit voluntarily to any penance, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs their faults, but rather maintain their errors with obſtinacy. Theſe can not be punished corporaly <hi>in foro externo</hi> by a ſpiritual Iudge, vntill their ſin and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs, be proued by cleer euidence of lawfull wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. So that it is a quite different power from that of a Confeſſor. If this obſtinacy therfore be not checkt and corrected by temporal and corporal penalties, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependently of the voluntary acceptation of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, it will encourage (and corrupt) others to the like inſolency; and deſtroy the whole Flock and the whole Order.

He who ſpares the rod, hates the child.</hi> Can you imagin, that Chriſt our Sauior doth hate his children, or that he would not leaue a rod in his Church, to chaſtie them with corporal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when vice and paſſion hath rendred them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of all ſpiritual admonitions and cenſures? If according to Scripture, <hi>Vexatio dat intellectum,</hi> why should you think that Chriſt would forbid his Church to vere by corporal punishments thoſe ſouls, which are not troubled or moued at ſpiritual ones? Jf cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral punishments or torments be proportionable or apt to punish, correct, deterr, and amend delinquents in the Common-wealth, why not alſo in the Church? would Chriſt haue his Church wors gouern'd, or more deſtitute of proportionable means to gouern, than a Commonwealth?</p>
               <p>Do you grant Mr. Walsh, that the Church of Chriſt ought not to be deſtitute of means ſufficient to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs its ends? Do you grant one of the ends of the ſame Church is, to conuert the moſt incredulous and obſtinat ſinners? Can you deny there are many ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſo incredulous and obſtinat, that no ſpiritual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions or Cenſures do them good. This you can not deny, for it is moſt euident in your ſelf; how often haue you bin admoniſh'd, how often excommunicated by your lawfull Superiors, for printing heretical, and non ſenſical bookes, and for intermedling in Church and ſtate affairs, contrary to your profeſſion, and without any commiſſion or capacity for ſuch employments? If you do not ſee this, you are the only perſon that doth not ſee it, and therfore your not ſeing, or at leaſt not belieuing, it, demonſtrats you are incredulous and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinat.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40690:26"/>This ſuppoſed, will not you acknowledge that this incredulity and obſtinacy of yours (which all the world doth iudge to be grounded vpon pride, and paſſion, may be leſſen'd, and reclaim'd by shutting you vp in a cell, giuing you ſpare diet, keeping you from ill company, that flatter and debauch you, and whipping you once or twice a day? I wiſh you would try it. The Scripture tells you, <hi>Virga &amp; correptio tribuunt ſapientiam.</hi> Proverb. 29. Theſe corporal vexations queſtionleſs would work more vpon you, than the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Cenſures haue don; for I doubt not but that Gods grace, by means of theſe helps, would make you reflect vpon your ſelf, and giue you vnderſtanding to ſee how ridiculous preſumption it is in an inconſiderable half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witted, and not ſo much as half learned petty friar, to take vpon himſelf to teach the whole, or the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of the Catholik Church, Faith and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, as if they had err'd in both for theſe 600. laſt years, and hath the impudence to print that all the Catholik Bishops now liuing are either Traytors to their Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns, or periur'd to the Pope.</p>
               <p>Now, Mr. Walsh, let's ſee, which of the two doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trins is deſtructiue to Soueraigns, yours or that of the Catholik Church? You ſtate the caſe in an vſurper, or Rebel againſt his lawfull King. He coms to confeſſion; the Confeſſarius enioyns him to reſtore the Kingdom to the right Souerain. He will not. I hope, ſay you <q>(pag. 79.) the Author of this Querie will not ſay, that euery ſuch Ghoſtly Father can proceed to execution whether the penitent will or no: or can by force of Arms, or other corporal means, deueſt them reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely of their ill gotten goods, Kingdoms, &amp;c.</q> And from this priuat and penitential power of a Confeſſarius, you inferr, that neither Biſhops nor Pope can in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ferue their Soueraign, as not being allowed by
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40690:27"/>God to proceed by force of Arms, or other corporal means againſt vſurpers and Rebells, <hi>though their deſign be no other than to put the lawfull Proprietor in poſſeſsion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr Walsh, ſee how heretical and deſtructiue your doctrin is. Suppoſe a thing which hath happened, and may happen very often. Suppoſe, I ſay, an vſurper or Rebell will not go to confeſſion, or if he doth, will not reſtore the vſurp't Kingdom or Prouince to his lawfull Soueraign according to his Confeſſarius his command. Hervpon the Biſhops of that Kingdom or Prouince, according to their duty, excommunicat the Tyrant, or Rebell for his publik ſin, and contumacy in keeping out of his Kingdom the lawfull King. He contemns their Cenſures. Let me ask you this queſtion. Do the Bishops ſin in raiſing (of their own accord, and as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops) an Army againſt the Tyrant or Rebell, only to put their lawfull King in poſſeſſion? Anſwer M. Walſh.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>R. Walsh, you charge the Roman Catholik Popes and Bishops euer ſince Pope Gregory 7. with treaſonable and impious principles and practiſes. Let vs compare yours with theirs, that ſo the truth may appear. You are Pope of this new Remonſtrant Church, which you confeſs, had (euen in its prime) but ſixty nine Church men in all the world. I belieue they are your Cardinals, you haue three caps yet to beſtow; the Cardinals you know are 72. Its good policy to keep ſom places vacant. But where are your Bishops and parish Prieſts? Muſt your Clergy be compos'd only of Cardinals? Nay where are your sheep, your flocks, Mr. Walsh; you name, but 97. Laiks, which number can not afford two Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishioners to each Paſtor. This is indeed a very litle flock <hi>puſillus grex;</hi> but great, I hope, in virtue and merit. Well! we will not ſay any thing againſt their perſons, but we will ſet down the fundamental principles, wherby you diſtinguish this bleſſed flock from that of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholik Church, which you call <hi>Papalin, puritan papiſt, popish recuſant</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Your 1. principle is, that the english oath of ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy may br

               <p>This is your Creed Mr. Walsh, the twelue articles of your Remonſtrant Religion.

Or only to proue that the Miracles wrought by God for S Thomas of Canterbury, may ſtand very well with hauing no truth or iuſtice on his ſide in his known controuerſy with King Henry 2. And that the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ouring and innoking him, as a true Martyr for maintaining its immunities, is no argument, that he defended therin iuſtice or truth; becauſe forſooth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther himſelf, nor any other did inuoke God to work the Miracles to euidence the truth or iuſtice of thoſe immunities S. Thomas maintain'd againſt the 16. or 12. lawes or cuſtoms of Henry 2. which were all in order to take away or diminish the Popes external ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual iuriſdiction and ſupremacy, and to aſſert in the King a coerciue power ouer the Clergy.</p>
               <p>I pray Mr. Walsh, where do you find it declared neceſſary, that the Myſteries of Chriſtian faith be made credible or confirm'd by a formal or expreſs inuocation of God to work miracles for euery one of them in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular? Chriſt himſelf taught, that Miracles confirm any general doctrin preacht by him who works them; neither doth he put that condition or caution of a particular and formal inuocation of God, without which you pretend the doctrin taught, or ſufferd for, may be falſe. But let that paſs. What more expreſs inuocation or declaration of God, can you deſire for the truth and iuſtice of S. Thomas of Canterbury's do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, than that ſo notorious and ſo long depending a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40690:33"/>controuerſy between the Church and ſtate, ſhould ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend all Chriſtendom, there being on the one ſide a powerfull Monarch, who ſtood for the pretended right of Kings, on the other but a poor banish't ſubiect, though a Biſhop, to maintain that of the Church? and that this poor man hauing bin murther'd (by flattering Courtiers) for maintaining the Church immunities, God ſhould work ſo many, and ſo vndeniable Miracles, at his dead body and Tomb, that you are not only fore't to confeſs they are true ones, but that King Henry 2. himſelf acknowledged S. Thomas had the truth and iuſtice on his ſide. And therfore to ſatisfy God and the world, rather for his vniuſt conteſt againſt the Church, than for the Saints murther (which the King neither intended nor deſired) that great Monarch did vndergo thoſe corporal punishments, which the Pope (as his ſpiritual Paſtor) commanded him to do; though you ſay he hath (as ſpiritual Paſtor) no power to inflict vpon your ſelf, as much as a <hi>Diſiplin,</hi> like that which the Monks of Canterbury gaue King Henry 2.

The drift and matter of the libel was, to diſſuade the people from admitting, or adhearing to that good peace, and from any agreement with the ſaid Matques of Ormond, becauſe forſooth, he deſign'd the Kings ruin, as well as theirs. This calumny <hi>Enos</hi> pretended to proue (and you approued of all, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the libel, and the Author in print, in the firſt leaf therof) becauſe his Excellency would not conclude before the yeare 46. any peace with the Iriſh, though he had poſitiue and preſſing commands from the King to do it; but for three or four years delayd it by vnprofitable and ſuſpitious ceſſations, in which time the King was ſubdued, and impriſon'd, and therfore his ſayd Lieutenant might pretend and plead that ſeruice (or at leaſt a neutrality) to the Parliament, when they

This made his moſt loyal actions and attempts (if not ſucceſsfull) be look't vpon as ſo many plots to ruin the King, and the only ſubiects then capable of helping him, the Iriſh. From hence proceeded the Towns re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to receiue his gariſons, from hence the diuiſions and diffidencies of the people, and Clergy; from hence the factions of Ormond and Oneal, of old Engliſh and old Iriſh; from hence the Cenſures and Declarations of the Biſhops at Iameſton againſt his grace; from hence all other diſorders, wherof you and <hi>Enos</hi> are more guilty than the Biſhops, or the common people.</p>

The vindication or Dublin libel ſayes, you writ with your own hand that fatal excommunication of the Popes Nuncius, wherby the Caſtle of Kilkenny (the key then of Ireland) was put into the Nuntius his hands; and that with this <hi>Excommunication</hi> you marcht vp to the Caſtle gate in your Franciſcan habit, and fixt it therupon with the ſame hand which writ it. What I know certainly is, that this Excommunication writ with your own hand, was deliuer'd to my Lord Iohn Berkley when he was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and am confident he hath it ſtill in his cuſtody, as an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of your loyalty, and of your being a fit man to preach it to others.</p>
               <p>To theſe three particulars, of the murther of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Engliſh, of your approuing <hi>Enos</hi> his libel againſt the Lord Marques of Ormond, and reiecting the peace of 46. and of your wreſting from the King, by an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication of your own hand writing, and fixing, the Caſtle and Citty of Kilkenny (and by conſequence the whole Kingdom of Ireland) I expected a cleer and particular anſwer in this great volume of yours, wherin you anſwer other obiections of leſs moment; truly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you named the <hi>Dublin libel,</hi> me thinks you ought rather to haue confuted it, at leaſt briefly, than ſpend ſo much time and paper in quoting the penalties, which the Canon and ciuil Law preſcribe againſt libellers. <hi>For the ſake of F. Peter Talbot the titular Archbishop of Dublin</hi> (ſay you page 51. of your Preface) <hi>and of his Complices, I took the pains to quote theſe Laws and Canons.</hi> Me thinks, I ſay, you ought rather <hi>for the ſake of Friar Peter Walsh</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:40690:36"/>haue confuted the pretended libel, then haue quoted the Lawes, that punish Libellers; becauſe none can be puniſh't by ſuch Lawes, before it be proued that the writing is a Libel. Indeed, Mr. Walsh, I was much ſurpris'd to ſee you remit Engliſh Readers
<note n="a" place="bottom">Pag. 50.</note> (for the confutation of theſe accuſations) into your latin <hi>Hiber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica,</hi> a book not as yet printed, and when printed, not vnderſtood by the generality of the English nation, which you ought to ſatisfy, and cleer your-ſelf from that horrid aſperſion of Treaſons, and english innocent bloud caſt vpon you; you shall ſee how your titular Archbishop of Dublin doth cleer himſelf of what you haue printed to his diſaduantage. I thought fit to giue the publik a view of the letter he writ for that purpoſe to a friend of his, who deſir'd it to ſatisfy himſelf and others.</p>

That I only ſcrupled the promiſe I had made (as all others do, who are not <hi>profeſs'd</hi>) of entring into the Society.</p>
                     <p>He anſwer'd, that he iudg'd in his conſcience I might without any ſcruple leaue the Society vpon the aforeſaid conſiderations; and as for the promiſe of entring therunto, that he had power to diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe therin, becauſe it was but <hi>votum ſimplex.</hi> And I was ſo ſimple as to take his word. So that you ſee I diſmiſs'd my ſelf, and vpon what ſcore, and by whoſe approbation. You ſee alſo what Kind of man Friar Walsh is, who both in his great English volum, and in his latin epiſtle to <hi>Harold,</hi> proclaims me an Apoſtat, and a Traytor to the King, as acting againſt him in the yeare <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I will briefly tell you the truth of all my Treaſons.

                        </gap>hended; wherupon they ſent me to London to obſerue and obſtruct (by their friends) he Commonwealths men deſign, but would not permit me to acquaint my own King with it, though indeed it was altogether for his intereſt. This journey
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40690:37"/>of mine from Bruſſells to England rais'd a iealouſy in the King and his Miniſters, as alſo in the Caualeers in London, who thought I came in that coniuncture, to further ſom ouertures of peace, which the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth party had made to the Spanish Miniſters. The Erle of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> who was very angry with me vpon the account of an imaginary Cardinal (I mean of an odd ſtory attributed to his Lordship) continualy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated to his Maieſty, the preiudice my negotiation might do his affairs. I ſatisfied as many of the Caualeers in London as I thought I might truſt with a ſecret, and aſſured them my endeauors were, and alwayes should be, to ſerue the King; and that there would be no peace with the Commonwealth party. The ſame I aſſured <hi>Peter Walsh</hi> vpon his telling me he was going then to Bruſſells, and deliuered to him a letter for my Lord of Ormond, wherin I gaue his Excellency the ſame aſſurances, I did the London Caualeers, adding that a litle time would proue me to be an honeſt man; for that I was then vpon my iourney to the Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>Pirenées,</hi> where the general peace was to be concluded; wherin I hop't England would not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, notwithſtanding the Ambaſſy and diligence of Sir <hi>Willian Locart</hi> to haue it comprehended in the Treaty</p>
                     <p>Arriuing at <hi>Fuenterabra,</hi> I went ſtraight to our Kings Reſidents houſe, and he telling me that he had many aduertiſſements of my ill intentions of obſtructing his Majeſtyes affairs, deſired me to aſſure him of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary by my word, which he would take, becauſe he thought I was an honeſt man, and knew that thoſe who writ againſt me to him, had bin formerly (in Flanders) miſtaken, both in my intereſt and intention of ſeruing the King. I shewed to the Kings Reſident all my papers, gaue him an account of my deſign, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40690:38"/>him, that <hi>Don Luis de Haro</hi> would giue me credit (as to my relation of the Kings intereſt being the only conſiderable in England) in caſe <hi>Don Alonſo de Cardenu,</hi> and the Marques of <hi>Caracona</hi> (as was generaly feard) should repreſent it otherwiſe. He finding the ſucceſs did anſwer my vndertaking, and his own expectation, gaue full ſatisfaction to the King of my fidelity and endeauors to ſerue him after that his Maieſty came to Fuenterabia. The ſame teſtimony was giuen to his Maieſty by <hi>Don Luis de Haro</hi> himſelf; and then the King was pleaſed to receiue me into his former grace and good opinion, as alſo my Lord of Ormond; who then truſted me with his concerns in the Court of Spain; (a penſion promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but neuer paid, vntill I ſent him from Madrid three thouſand eight hundred pounds in one Bill, the ſumme due to him) Notwithſtanding that my Lord of <hi>Clarendons</hi> anger did ſtill continue (he neuer forgaue the ſtory of the Cardinal, wherin I had no hand) yet the King (after his happy reſtauration) was gratiouſly pleaſed (againſt the Lord Chancelors will) to name me one of the Queens Almoniers; but his Lordship, and the Marques of <hi>Sandy</hi> Ambaſſador of Portugal, found wayes ſoon after to depriue me of that honor. Heere you haue all my Treaſons which Peter Walsh hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed and diſperſed in print with myſterious words, and malititious reflexions, contrary to his own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the knowledge of the whole Court.</p>
                     <p>As to his railing and ſaying (pag. 530.) that I went to his Chamber in London an. 1644. <hi>to importune him to take off a certain nobleman</hi> (he means my Lord Duke of Ormond) <hi>from hindering</hi> my being made a Bishop; the truth is, I went to Friar Walsh his Chamber; but with greater indifferency than importunity; for I shewed him the letter I had then receiued from the <hi>Inter-Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40690:38"/>from Rome a Biſhoprik; and I remember very well, I told <hi>Peter Walsh,</hi> I valued not the offer ſo much as to accept of it, without my Lord of Ormonds (then Lieutenant of Ireland) approbation; and that I was very indifferent, whether he would allow of ſuch a thing or no. And indeed if I had not bin very indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, I would neuer haue made vſe of Friar Walſh his mediation, whoſe deſign then was knowen to be, to hinder all ſuch promotions vntill himſelf had bin named Archbiſhop of Dublin, And his Camerade <hi>Caron</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Armagh. But I admire Walſh is not aſham'd to touch this paſſage; his Diabolycalenuy, and fooliſh ambition hauing hurried him (immediatly vpon the ſight of my Letter) to my Lord of Ormond, informing him of his fears, that the <hi>Talbots</hi> had a plot to aſſaſinat his Grace, as he had ground to ſuſpect by a word that fell from one of the Brothers, either Thomas or Peter Talbot (he knew not which forſooth) and therfore as his Graces Seruant, he came to aduertiſe him of it; wherupon enſued the impriſonment of three brothers, which gaue occaſion of murmuring to many, and laughter to moſt, to ſee ſuch a noiſe made of what was found to be nothing elſe but the malice and plot of a knauiſh friar, that endeuor'd to deſtroy a whole family, leaſt one of them might lye in his way, or hinder him from that <hi>miter</hi> he look't after. But a man who had Sacrificed the preſeruation of his King and Countrey (by preaching and publiſhing Excommunications a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the peace of 46.) to the vain hopes of obtaining a Biſhoprik from his maſter the <hi>Nuncius,</hi> would make no ſcruple to haue three brothers put to death for a feign'd conſpiracy againſt the life of a priuy Councellor. What troubled me moſt in this <hi>intrigue,</hi> was the loſs of Sir Robert Talbots Eſtate, and of a conſiderable ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me for ten years Agency, ſetled by Act of Parliament,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40690:39"/>vpon him, and the other Agents; into which was inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I know not how an obſcure odd kind of clauſe of preference of payment in fauor of Mr. <hi>Milo Power</hi> (as if he had bin a mor meriting and ſuffering Caualeer) before Sir Robert Talbot and others both Agents, and Caualiers. And though euery one knowes <hi>Mr. Milo Power</hi> to be a very worthy gentleman, and pleaſant company, its alſo well knowen, that though his affection to the Kings ſeruice be as great as any mans, yet the poſſibility of ſhewing it, or of looſing much for it, was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to the ſufferings and ſeruices of thoſe, who loſt the benefit of the Act vpon his account. And indeed Sir Robert Talbot ought to be pittied, becauſe hauing bin employd by the publik, he neglected his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular concern, meerly out of honor; leaſt it ſhould be thought (as it was reported, but groundleſly, of others) that to ſecure his own eſtate he concurr'd to the ruin of his Countrey.</p>
                     <p>As for Friar Walſh his no leſs ridiculous than mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious obſeruation and Comments vpon the moſt R. Father <hi>Olina</hi> his letter to me, and my deuotion and reſpect to him, and the whole Society, I muſt own to the whole world, I ſhould be as ill a man, and as great a lyar as Waſh himſelf (and that is the worſt can be ſayd of any man) if I did not eſteem very much, and ſpeake well of the virtue and learning of that Society. Few can ſpeake with more knowledge, and none ſhall with leſs partiality. I haue bin in moſt of their Prouinces of Europe, I haue liued in their moſt famous Colleges, and taught in ſom: I neuer was in any College or Community of theirs, where there was not one, or more, of known eminent Sanctity; many of extraordinary virtue, and none, that I knew, vicious; I alwayes found their Superiors charitable and ſincere, their Procurators deuout, their Profeſſors humble, though learned; their
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40690:39"/>yong maſters of humanity, and ſtudents of Philoſophy, or Diuinity, very chaſt; and if any gaue the leaſt ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of being otherwiſe, he was preſently diſmiſſed. It is my greateſt admiration how ſo great a body, ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraly employ'd, and truſted by the greateſt Princes, ſo conuerſant in the world (according to their holy inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tut) can ſauor ſo litle of it, and liue ſo innocently as they do; and euen forſake the beſt part of it (Europe) their many conueniencies, and relations (which are illuſtrious) and baniſh themſelues to <hi>Aſia, Afrik,</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> vpon no other account but that of ſauing ſouls. In their Schools they teach not thoſe infamous doctrins, which that foulmouthd Friar <hi>Walsh</hi> aſperſeth their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors with, and ſayes I do practiſe; but are very reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in deliuering any larger opinion, euen of the moſt famous writers; for feare men ſhould abuſe and miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their authority. This is the ſubſtance of what I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſaid, and muſt ſay, if I will ſpeake truth, of an Order wherin I haue liued many years with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; and truly ſo innocently (through Gods grace, and their example) that the greateſt ſin I can charge my ſelf with, during my abode amongſt them, is the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution I took of leauing them, though (perhaps erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly) I framed then a iudgement, that the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances wherin I found my ſelf, did excuſe it from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mortal.</p>
                     <p>But afterwards reflecting with more maturity and leſs paſſion vpon the poſitiueneſs of that my reſolution, notwithſtanding the charitable offers of the Superiors aboue mentioned, as ſoon as I knew I was deſign'd to be made Biſhop, I offerd to F. General <hi>Oliua,</hi> and F. <hi>Ioſeph Simons,</hi> then Prouincial of England, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter into the Society; but they (thinking perhaps I could not be of any great ſeruice, to it, and edified with my ſincere reſignation of being directed in that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40690:40"/>particular as they iudged beſt for my ſaluation) did of their own accord, forward by fauorable informations, and a better caracter than I deſerued, the promotion which the Court of Rome had deſign'd for me. I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing notice of this ciuility, could do no leſs than write a letter of thanks to Father General <hi>Oliua,</hi> and he anſwerd me in thoſe, vſual vnſignificant and general terms, wherwith Generals of Regular Orders congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulat new made Prelats; and wherupon Peter Walſh makes very ſilly but malicious reflexions, to perſuade the ſimpler ſort of people, that my promotion was carried on by the Ieſuits, as if it had bin a buiſneſs of great importance for their Order, or as if their Order had bin hugely concern'd in the diſcredit of his ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Remonſtrance, which needed not be diſgrac't o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than by ſaying it was his.</p>
                     <p>As for my anſwer to his petition againſt me, preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Councel in England, I could not excuſe anſwering it, hauing bin commanded by the Lord Lieutenant and Councel of Ireland, where I was, to put in my anſwer, which containd nothing but truth; and ſo it appear'd to that honorable Bord, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared me innocent. It was no other, but that I neuer perſecuted, him nor any of his ſeuen Friars Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants, in whoſe behalf he petitioned; neither did I, nor could I excommunicat any Regulars, who (by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Canons) are exempted from the <hi>Ordinarys</hi> iuriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; neither indeed did their own regular Superiors puniſh them for ſigning the Remonſtrance, but for cheating the people of money, and for exacting it from the Kings Subiects by virtue of a counterfeit commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Pope. I did afterwards tell ſom of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy Councellors, and others, that I was ſurpriſed to ſee ſuch criminal perſons countenanc't in preſcribing ruler of loyalty to men whoſe families (an well old Iriſh, as
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40690:40"/>old engliſh) had for theſe 500. years paſt, ſtuck (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to duty) to the Crown of England, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues had ſuffer'd ſo particularly vpon the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. That as to my own family the Nuncius, and his Dean of <hi>Fermo</hi> endeuored to haue myſelf baniſht out of Rome, as an <hi>Ormonian;</hi> that Sir Robert Talbots houſes and Tenants were deſtroyd by the <hi>Nuncius</hi> party in Ireland, his command taken from him, himſelf im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon'd, as hauing bin the only man in Ireland (euen of the Ormonian party) who would not giue his voto in a ſubſequent general Aſſembly for reiecting the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of 46. notwithſtanding that General <hi>Oneals</hi> Army was at hand, and the Bishop of <hi>Clogher</hi> enraged at his ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches for the Aſſemblies reaſſuming the ſame peace, which Peter Walſh had ſo diſloyaly cry'd down from pulpit and preſs, by commending ſo ſeaſonably for the Nuncius, and ſo ſeditiouſly againſt the Kings intereſt and ſafety, D. <hi>Enos</hi> his libel againſt that peace, and the proceedings of my Lord of Ormond.</p>
                     <p>But what is moſt falſely aſſerted by <hi>Peter Walsh</hi> is, that in my anſwer I did giue a touch of the murther he is charged with. I toucht not any ſuch thing, I am ſure I did not intend to be his Accuſer in any cauſe of bloud, and I hindred others from accuſing him, as my Brother <hi>Iohn Talbot</hi> had alſo don; nay I had him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed of his danger (by a friend of his own) as ſoon as Father <hi>Cauenagh,</hi> and Father <hi>Bremingham</hi> atteſted the murther at Caſtleton in preſence of my Lord Dongan, Mr. Chaſles White of Leixſlip, my ſelf, and others; For, though his barbarous inhuman cruelty (if what is ſaid of him be true) deſerues ten thouſand deaths, yet I would not for all the world concurr to it. The thankes he gaue me for letting him know his danger (to the end he might retire to his Conuent, and do pennance for his ſins) was, to miſinforme the honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40690:41"/>Houſe of commons and the committee of Religion, by one of the two Mr. Warnhams (commonly known by the name of <hi>Flahertys Varnham</hi>) that I did moſt impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently exerciſe papal iuriſdiction in Ireland, by excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating and cenſuring his Majeſties moſt loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects for ſubſcribing to the Remonſtrance. And though this was known in Ireland to be a fable, yet Mr. <hi>Varn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and ſom others of Friar Walſh his friends, auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it to be very true, I haue ſufferd much vpon that account; and that infamous Friar, though a known Traytor to God and the King, laught in his ſleeue, after abuſing the Parliament with notoriouſly falſe informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and inſults for hauing bin ſo ſuccesfull in exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the Caualeer party againſt one who endeauored to ſerue many of them in their exile abroad; as ſom of them ſince were pleaſed to teftify, though too late for my relief, and redreſs of the iniury don to me.</p>
                     <p>My buiſneſs is not to exaggerat this mans miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, but rather to warn him once more of his danger, and aduiſe him not to be ſo publik in London, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting great Prelats and Noblemens houſes, vpon whom he muſt needs draw inconueniencies, if he doth not cleer himſelf of treaſons and murthers better then by ſaying in his great engliſh Tome of Iriſh Rapſody, that all theſe accuſations are lyes, or libels of the titular Archbiſhop of Dublin, or of his friends; and then tell his Readers he will vindicat himſelf in his latin Iriſh work. Me thinks he might haue reſerued ſom of his vnneceſſary vncouth ſpeeches, and tedious repetitions, for that work; and in lieu therof cleer himſelf of thoſe foul aſperſions, at leaſt in a <hi>parenteſis;</hi> ſom of his, being long enough to weary any patient Reader, and to iuſtify any honeſt man. This I hope is enough to vindicat me from Peter Walſh his calumnies, which do not much trouble me, it being the greateſt honor of an honeſt

               <p>Mr. Walſh, I haue bin aſſured by credible perſons, that what this Prelat ſayes heer of you and himſelf, is very true; and that a man would be laught at in Ireland (where theſe things happen'd) if he queſtion'd ſo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious matters of fact, wherof there are yet liuing many legal witneſſes. This ſuppoſed I muſt needs blame you for printing ſuch lyes to diſcredit a Biſhop, or at leaſt for not prouing what you ſay of him by more credible arguments than the bare aſſertion of your-ſelf in your own cauſe. If you, being but a priuat perſon, and a petty Friar, ſay (pag. 51. of your Preface) that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Dublin libel (for writing againſt you ſom pretended vntruths) ought by the ciuil lawes to be put to death; and by <hi>the Canon of Pope Adrian, be ſtript naked, and whipt with ſcourges, if he can not proue the truth of the particulars of his libel;</hi> what will the world ſay of you, for writing manifeſt vntruths of an Archbishop? Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialy when you can not proue that he is the Author, or that you are iniur'd by that <hi>Dublin libel,</hi> as you call it; and for want of an anſwer to the particulars therin alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt you, remit your engliſh Reader to a latin Iriſh work, not yet compoſed, not euer like to be printed? I am troubled Mr. Walſh, at this malitious folly of yours. But patience. I will now conſider how your Remonſtrant Church came to fail and fall.</p>

Walſh, you complain very much (pag. 577. &amp; ſeq. of the ſecond part of your firſt long Treatiſe) that the <hi>Anti Remonſtrants not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their oppoſition againſt you, loſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing either of liberty, or other benefits or fanors at home from the Ciuil Magiſtrate, from the Lord Lieutenant, or Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, or his Court, Council, or Parliament; being equal in all ſuch (for any material thing) to the Remonſtrants: and on the other ſide were ſure of all euen extraordinary fauors &amp;c. from their own Church, and from the Conrt of Rome abroad, while the Remonſtrants were ſure of nothing from either, but ſlight from the one, and extreme perſecution from the other. And theſe fate laſt years, from</hi> 1667. <hi>to the end of the preſent year</hi> 1672 <hi>haue giuen ſufficient arguments of both the one and the other. During which time, thoſe poor Remonſirants had nothing to ball<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>This is a very ſad ſtory Mr. Walſh, but the Dublin libel (as you call it) tells you an other quite contrary; and you know it to be true; nay you giue a hint of it
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40690:42"/>in the pag 3. of your Preface to the Catholiks (which needed an other Preface, itſelf being a large book.) There you ſay, that the <hi>Anti-Remonſtrants perſecuted your (holy) Church in a moſt ſurious manner with all the vileſt arts of malicious Cabals, Conſpiraties, Plots, libels, and an Impoſtor Commiſsary and a forged Commiſsion.</hi> What's that Mr. Walſh? An Impoſtor Commiſſary! A forged Commiſſion! I pray explain yourſelf. Did the Anti Remonſtrants per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute your Remonſtrance and Church by an Impoſtor Commiſſary and a forged Commiſſion? did the court of Rome, ſend ſuch a perſon, and giue him ſuch a commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? If ſo, he was no Impoſtor. Well: I ſee thoſe Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans are ſtrange men. Is it poſſible they could be ſo ill natur'd as to perſuade a poor Friar to play the Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor? or that he would be perſuade to play the fool and knaue ſo egregiouſly, meerly to vndermine your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrant Church? Good God, in what a great miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke hath the world bin theſe 9. or ten years. Truly Mr. Walſh, 'tis the perſuaſion of all England, Ireland, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and Italy, that you and the Impoſtor Commiſſary agreed to perſecute the Roman Catholik Clergy; and vnderſtood one an other ſo well, that you combin'd to cheat the Kings Subiects of money, and to eſtabliſh the Remonſtrant Church by virtue of the ſame impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and forged Commiſſion, wherby your viſitators and Collectors raiſed good ſumms for the Commiſſary Apoſtolyks occaſions and expence.</p>
               <p>This common perſuaſion ſeems to be well grounded. 1. You could not be ignorant the Commiſſary was an Impoſtor, becauſe he had no other Commiſſion to ſhew for his authority ouer all the Clergy of Ireland, both ſecular and regular, but a copy of the pretended Original; and that ſo litle authentik, that to gain it credit, you got the vnwary Bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hop of <hi>Ardagh</hi> to confirm it as a true one 2. the Commiſſary had no inſtructions;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:40690:43"/>a thing vnuſual and vnheard of in any perſon authoriſed with ſuch an employment. But this defect you ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by drawing inſtructions for his viſitators (which are extant of your own hands writing) all which tended to the eſtabliſhment of your Remonſtrant Church. And theſe inſtructions written with your own hand Mr. Walſt, ſhall be produced whenſoeuer you pleaſe. So that if you did not forge the Commiſſion, you drew for the Commiſſarys Inſtructions. 3. You knew very well, it was not a likely thing that the Court of Rome would giue ſo ample a power to an ordinary Friar, ouer Biſhops, and all regular Superiors. 4. When the It ſuits made difficulty to ſubmit to your Impoſtor Commiſſary, ſtanding vpon the Priuileges of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, you reprehended them ſeuerely, and gaue God thanks that your-ſelf was ſo deuoted to the Pope, as not to diſpute his Commiſſaries authority, when they, who by a peculiar vow are tyed to obey his Holineſs, were refractory; and vpon this, you, and by your example the reſt kneeld down, crauing the Impoſtor Commiſſaries benediction, and owning his authority. 5. He was wholy directed by you, ſtill in your compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; he was your old acquaintance, and of your own Order. How is it then poſſible, ſo remarkable an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture as this, could be conceald from a man ſo curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and corcern'd as you were in this intrigue?

None durſt complain of theſe exactions, the Collectors pretending your power and fauor with the gouernment was ſo great, as to wink at theſe your moſt illegal proceedings.</p>
               <p>Theſe were your ſufferings and perſecutions Mr. Walſh. But you know perſecution if not ſuffered for <hi>iuſtice,</hi> is not meritorious. You ſay your Remonſtrant
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40690:44"/>Church ſuffered this great perſecution, <hi>for profeſsing and performing their duty to the King, according to the law of God.</hi> I pray is it a duty to the King according to the law of God, to impoſe vpon and leuy from his Subiects mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney by the Popes authority, either counterfeit or real? We Anti-Remonſtrants maintain the Pope hath no ſuch power nor authority. Your Remonſtrants main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain he hath, as appears by your Excommunications and ſuſpenſions yet extant. Js this your duty to the King? Is this according to the law of God? Is this a bare ſatisfaction of conſcience for profeſſing and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming your duty? Complain not then Mr. Walſh, that you and your Remonſtrant Church was ſlighted by the King, by the Council, by the Parliaments, and Lords Lieutenants. They clearly perceiued ye were but a company of Cheats, that pretended loyalty, and practiſed treaſon; to be for the King, and ruin'd his Subjects by the Popes pretended authority.</p>
               <p>Beſides Mr. Walſh, you cheated my Lord Duke of Ormond as well in the beginning as in the whole progreſs of your Remonſtrance. You made his grace belieue, that you were commiſſioned and had power to preſent that Formulary to his Majeſty, and to him, in the name of the Clergy of Ireland, both ſecular and regular; and yet the power you had, was but from very few; and that power was in order to obtain for the Clergy the benefit of the peace 1648. (as appeareth by their inſtrument pag. 5. of your Hiſtory) wherof one atticle is, there ſhould not be tendred any other oath, or <hi>Formulary</hi> of Allegiance to them, but one which is ſet down in the ſame articles, to which your Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance is manifeſtly oppoſit. Moreouer you confeſs pag. 6. that <hi>you were ſoundly check't by his Grace (as you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected) for daring to reteine ſuch an inſtrument from ſuch men; that is, men, as to the generality and chief of them, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40690:44"/>and lately too ſo caractered as they were for being in their indignations and carriage very much diſaffected to his Majeſties intereſts, and very obnoxious to the Laws.</hi> You ſee Mr. Walſh, what thankes ſuch buiſy Friars as you get, for intermedling in aflairs, whether Miniſters of ſtate, and the people concern'd will or no. On the other ſide you cheated the Iriſh Clergy and Gentry, making the Clergy belieue, they ſhould haue liberty to exerciſe their functions; and the Gentry that they ſhould be reſtored to their eſtates, if they ſign'd your Remonſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance. I pray Mr. Waſh, how many of the 95. no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen and Gentlemen that ſubſcribed, are reſtored to their Eſtates by your Remonſtrance? name at leaſt one, who hath bin the better for his ſubſcription? A man would think that my Lord of <hi>Iueaghs</hi> extraction, innocency, and merit; his breaking General <hi>Oneales</hi> Army; his raiſing and looſing two or three Regiments in the Kings ſeruice; his venturing himſelf, and his neereſt relations in the towns beſieged by Cromu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ll; his conſtant following his Majeſties perſon and fortune in exile, needed no further remonſtrance of his loyalty; but howeuer, that nothing might be obiected againſt him, he ſign'd yours; and yet is nothing the neerer his Eſtate. I know you preſſed my Lord Duke of Ormond very much in Sir Robert Talbots behalf, ſaying it would be a great ſcandal, if the only gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in Ireland, who neuer would reiect the peace of 46. and ſufferd ſo much vpon that account, were not reſtored to his Eſtate, and yet you ſee he was, and his ſon is, in the ſame condition with the reſt of your ſubſcribers.</p>
               <p>But the moſt damnable cheat of all Mr. Walſh, is, that you made the ſubſcribers belieue, your Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance was only a recognition of his Majeſties ſupreme temporal authority and right to his Kingdoms; but
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40690:45"/>now you declare that it aſſerts, all which the oath of Supremacy doth, and that Roman Catholiks are raſh and obſtinat (and by conſequence commit a ſin) in denying to take the oath of ſupremacy, wherof (as was well known to ſuch as refus'd to ſubſcribe) this your Remonſtrance contains the ſubſtance; which is, that temporal Soueraigns may by their own ſole autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity gouern the Church, and make lawes in Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical matters, euen of Faith. To proue this and the lawfullneſs of your Remonſtrance, renouncing all thoſe <hi>papalin</hi> or <hi>popish recuſants</hi> doctrins, againſt which the oath of ſupremacy was made, and is tender'd, is the ſubiect and ſcope of this great Tome of yours: This is your own ingenious confeſſion; theſe your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uors ſince the year 61. You ſhould haue told this in the beginning to the Layty, and to ſuch of the Clergy as vnderſtood not your deſign and doctrin. Now that they all know both, you muſt not admire, if euen the ſubſcribers deteſt you as a betrayer of their ſouls, as well as of the Kings intereſt, not only by your former acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but now alſo by your bookes and writings, incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating to all Biſhops and other Churchmen, that they commit a ſin, if, (as Churchmen) they concurr and contribute with their reuenues, or any other corporal means, to preſerue their King, or to reſtore him, if God ſhould, for our ſins, permit an other reuolution, and that his right were poſſeſs'd by a rebel or Tyrant. Is this Chriſtian or Catholik doctrin? Hath the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual calling or caracter of a Biſhop, or of a Clergy man, ſuch antipathy with the duty of a ſubiect, and of ſpiritual Father, that a Biſhop or Prieſt muſt ſin, if either of them apply his temporal goods to the ſupport of his lawfull Prince? You may as well maintain, that the caracter of Baptiſm, or <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> muſt make it a ſin (in lay ſubiects) to defend or reſtore their lawfull
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40690:45"/>Soueraign; for <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is as ſolemn and ſpiritual a profeſſion of following Chriſts doctrin, as Epiſcopacy
<note n="a" place="bottom">Friar Walſh is half a Blakloiſt.</note> and Prieſtod is. I ſee Mr. Walſh, you are half a <hi>Blak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loiſt: Blaklow</hi> and you agree in ſaying, that Subiects can not in conſcience concurr to reſtore a diſpoſſeſs'd lawfull ſoueraign; but you ſay it only of the Clergy; he, of all. You ground your error vpon the ſpiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and ſupernaturality of the Clergyes caracter; <hi>Blaklow</hi> vpon the nature of man; which (as that heretical Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor pretends in his book of <hi>Obedience and Gouernment</hi>) inclines him rationaly, and obliges him to preferr his quiet and ſhare of the human conueniencies of an v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpt gouernment before the Diuine right which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Soueraigns haue to be temporal Gouernors (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God) of their Subjects, and the obligation Subiects haue to venter their liues and fortunes to aſſert that right, and reſtore their lawfull Soueraigns in caſe they ſhould be diſpoſeſt therof. Its no more a meruail to me, that the
<note n="b" place="bottom">See Doctor Ceorge Leyburns Apology.</note> pretended <hi>Dean and Chapter</hi> of England, which commended <hi>Blaklows</hi> doctrin as <hi>eminent,</hi> after he had writ this deſtructiue <hi>Tenet,</hi> did alſo commend your Remonſtrance. But I admire, you ſhould boaſt ſo much (pag. 55.) of their approbation, as to print, their Dean's letter to the Biſhop of <hi>Dromore,</hi> for an euidence therof. Conſider, what credit can ſuch mens approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as cry vp <hi>Blaklows</hi> condemned doctrin and bookes, for <hi>eminent,</hi> be to yours? I am ſure ſuch principles as theſe, are not to be tolerated either in the Church, or commonwealth.</p>
               <p>Ceaſe then to complain, and to wonder Mr. Walſh, that our King, our Parliaments, our priuy Councellors, and the Lords Lieutenants of Ireland, ſlight a Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance and doctrin which doth inculcat or inferr ſo
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40690:46"/>vnchriſtian Tenets as yours, ſo deſtructiue to Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy and morality, ſo incontinent with the ſafety of Soueraigns, and the duty of Subiects. What think you Mr. Walſh of the Clergy of France? Do they ſin when euery fifth or third year in their Aſſemblies they voluntarily tax themſelues, and giue ſo conſiderable ſumms to their King for his occaſious? They do not giue this help as temporal Peers or Barons of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alm, but as Biſhops, Abbots, Priors, Curats &amp;c. Do they ſin, I ſay, in doing this? Doth the Spaniſh Clergy ſin in giuing their <hi>Milliones</hi> voluntarily, and as a Clergy, to their King? Doth the Pope ſin for concurring as Pope with them by Bull or licence for theſe donations? If your Remonſtrant Church had com to that perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you flatter'd yourſelf with, ſure your Clergy would haue bin very rich, for they muſt not haue giuen vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily as Biſhops one penny of their Reuenues to the King, to defend himſelf or the Kingdom againſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells, or foreign Inuaders. But if an Impoſtor Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary comes, he way by a forged commiſſion and the Popes authority impoſe a taxe vpon the Kings Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and leuy it by Excommunications and Cenſures. Js your loyal Formulary, and Reformation of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholik Church of theſe laſt 600. years com to this Mr. Walſh? Who is the Traytor, who is the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tik? You, for your Remonſtrance, or all the Biſhops in the world for taking the vſual oath at their Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations? For shame, Mr. Walſh, repent, retract, and retire to your Conuent, and neuer write more of matters you vnderſtand not. But before you retire, I will ſolue a very curious and material queſtion, put by yourſelf in the page 579. of the ſecond part of your firſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But if any demand</hi> (ſaith Friar Walſh ſect. 2. pag. 579) <hi>how it came to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And yet alſo theſe very few ſo profeſsing to be ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and only therfore, by their Aduerſaries without any feare or shame oppoſed, yea to their power, perſecuted?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is, Mr. Walſh, a rational doubt, if rightly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. You miſtake the queſtion; it ought to be this. How coms it to paſs that of the great and numerous body of the loyal Iriſh Catholik Clergy, that approued themſelues ſo in the occaſion of tryal, an, 1648. there ſhould be found ſo many as 69. an. 1662. that ſubſcribed to Peter Walſh his Remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, ſo deſtructiue to the Kings ſafety, right and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as he hath bin demonſtrated? Now I will ſolue this queſtion.</p>
               <p>Yow know Mr. Walſh when ambitious and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Friars, who aſpire to Biſhopriks, and hate the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty and diſciplin of their inſtitute, want friends and money, they inuent twenty deuices to compaſs both. Now, <hi>Redmund Caron</hi> and you, were reſolued to be Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, the one of Armagh, the other of Dublin. You deſpar'd of obtaining Miters by your merit, and the ordinary wayes; therfore you reſolued to fright the Court of Rome into it by ſetting vp this your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance; and including yourſelues into eccleſiaſtical and ſtate affairs; you importun'd two great Miniſters of ſtate to countenance the preſſing of your <hi>Formulary,</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:40690:47"/>vpon the Iriſh Clergy and Gentry, which had ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſerued and followed the King in the worſt of times, by ſhedding their bloud and ſpending their Eſtates in his quarrel, that they needed not any paper inſtrument to manifeſt or confirm their loyalty. And though the Miniſters knew this very well, and vnderſtood as well that it was not any good zeal, but your ambition and couetouſneſs, which moued <hi>Caron</hi> and you to buiſy yourſelues in a matter very improper for your calling, and much aboue your capacities; yet for reaſons beſt knowen to themſelues, and common to all ſtateſmen, they were content to let two ſuch fellows as you, preach and preſs a <hi>Formulary,</hi> which they foreſaw would diuide the Catholiks amongſt themſelues, diſcredit their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and giue the gouernment the color and aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of excluding from their Eſtates many meriting gentlemen, for not profeſſing that allegiance, which learned Friars of their own perſuaſion, maintain'd to be abſolutely neceſſary in a faithfull Subiect: So that your Remonſtrance ſerued to exclude many honeſt men from their right, but neuer reſtored any to his inheritance; though many (foold by you and <hi>Caron</hi>) put their hands to it in hopes of receiuing therby the benefit of the peace 48.</p>
               <p>As for your 69. Clergymen that ſubſcribed the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance, yourſelf doth confeſs (pag. 578. part. 2.1. Treat) <hi>Som fell off immediatly after their ſigning in the yeare</hi> 1662. — <hi>Others were content only to haue ſign'd it, like ſo many Nicodemus de nocte; not acknowledging amongſt the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers what they had don. Som, who albeit they had ſufficient iudgment to guide themſelues, or their own perſonal duty in order to themſelues alone; yet had not thoſe abilities either to perſuade or ſatisfy others. Finaly there was not wanting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſt them a falſe and treacherous troubleſom and impudent Brother &amp;c. who diſcouered all might do them prejudice, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40690:47"/>betray, them too wherin ſoeuer he might.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſee Mr. Walſh, that of your 69. Eccleſiaſtical ſubſcribers, ſom fell off immediatly; others durſt not own their ſubſcription; others knew not how to iuſtify it; and one falſe Brother betrayd your Councells or cheats. The matter is wors than I thought. I pray how many able conſtant ſubſcribers are there left in your Remonſtrant Church? When you petitioned the King and Councell in its behalf againſt the titular Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Dublin, you could name but ſeuen; and four of the ſeuen fell off then: and I belieue the other two haue don the ſame ſince. What? A Church, and none but one Friar Walſh to profeſs its Faith? Is AntiChriſt com? Euen in his time the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity will be more then one. One makes no Congregation, and by conſequence no Church. But you ſay (pag. 577.) the deceaſed Biſhop of <hi>Dromore, Oliner Darcy,</hi> was one. What then? Doth his authority weigh more than that of all the Biſhops who condemn your Remonſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance?</p>
               <p>I abſtain as much as I can from cenſuring the dead; but I can not well in this occaſion, you relying ſo much vpon this deceaſed Biſhops authority, who was the only that ſubſcrib'd to your Remonſtrance. This obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges me to diminiſh a litle his credit. Father <hi>Iohn Talbot,</hi> of whom you ſaid when he dyed (as if it were a rarity, or kind of miracle) <hi>There lyes one honeſt Ieſuit,</hi> aſſured me, that after his Brother Sir Robert Talbot had with the reſt of the Commiſſioners, at length, concluded with my Lord of Ormond the peace of 1646. Sir Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert went in great haſt from Dublin to Conaght, where General <hi>Preſion</hi> then was with his Army, and perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that General to haue the peace proclaim'd in the head of the ſame. A litle after, the Nuntius began to treat with you, and Friar <hi>Oliner Darcy</hi> (before he was
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40690:48"/>Bishop of Dromore) who was General Preſton's Ghoſtly Father; and vpon that ſcore could do much with him. Sir Robert Talbot hauing bin made Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for his zeal to the Kings ſeruice, and to that peace, charged his Brother Iohn Talbot, to keep ſtill neer General <hi>Preſton,</hi> to the end he might keep him conſtant to the peace; for that he feard Friar Oliuer Darcy (v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the hopes which were giuen him of a Bishoprik) would make the General alter his reſolution. F. Iohn Talbot did ſo, and hauing certain intelligence that Friar <hi>Darcy</hi> had vndertaken to the Nuncius to gain <hi>Preſton</hi> to his party, he ask't the General (at Lucan) whether he was ſtill conſtant to the reſolution he had taken of reaſſuming and adhering to the peace of 46. as he had lately promiſed to my Lord of Ormond. He ſayd he was, and the rather becauſe Friar Oliuer Darcy told him, he ought to be ſo. Father Iohn replyed, my Lord, will you giue me your word, and hand, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo, though Father Darcy should aduiſe you to the contrary? The General laught at the improbabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſuch a thing. But the weak, though honeſt General, fell from his reſolution by the Friars impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, who had bin gain'd by the <hi>Nuncius;</hi> and vpon this Friar Oliuer Darcy was made Bishop of Dramo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.</p>
               <p>Now I will tell you Mr. Walsh, how he came to be the chief ſubſcriber of your Remonſtrance. Be not ſtartled; do not think I am a witch; there are hundreds can tell you as well as I, though you make it a ſecret. This poor Bishop had the misfortune to hinder his Brother Sir <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mes Darcy</hi> from doing his duty of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the King into Flanders with the Duke of yorks Regiment (which he commanded) when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued Orders to take his paſs, as the other Colonells did. Hereby the Bishop incurr'd his Kings diſpleaſure,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40690:48"/>and ruin'd the fortune of his Brother, a very loyal worthy gentleman, and a good Commander. After the Kings happy reſtauration, this vndutifull carriage of the Bishop was not forgot at whitehall; and he not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to liue in France, hauing alſo a deſire to return to his own Countrey, writ to you Mr. Walsh, that he would do any thing you would haue him do, ſo he might be permitted to return and liue at home. A large offer, and an argument of a large conſcience, in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances wherin he knew you wanted and ſought (at this very time) a Bishop to head your vpſtart Church. You took him at his word, and he ſet his hand to to your Remonſtrance. Whether he repented, or no, at his death, I know not, but I am ſure Friar <hi>Redmund Caron,</hi> whom you canonize for a Saint (pag. 759.) ought to haue retracted the doctrin of his <hi>Remonſtrantia Hibernorum,</hi> which was ſtuff't with ſo notorious and palpable falſifications, that he can not be preſumed to haue bin ignorant of them. But his laſt aduice and <hi>Adieu</hi> to you is ſad, and remarkable; for, he declared (as you ſay pag. 760.) <hi>That you were bound in conſcience to proſecute ſtill, euen after his death, that matter</hi> (of the Remonſtrance) <hi>and continue the defence or aduancement of that doctrin, which in his life time you had for ſo many years, and notwithſtanding ſo much contradiction, maintain'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You do a great iniury, Mr. Walsh, to the memory and merit of that Illuſtrious and Catholik Prelat, <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Deaſe, quondam</hi> Bishop of Meath, in ioyning him (in the ſame page) with <hi>Caron,</hi> as approuing at his death of your Remonſtrance, and doctrin. What if he did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue of the book of <hi>Queries?</hi> Was there any thought or knowledge then of your Remonſtrance? Is there any thing in that book of <hi>Queries,</hi> aſſerting a ſpiritual ſupremacy in Princes, or denying it to the Pope? Doth it ſay that Secular Princes by <hi>their own ſole authority</hi> may
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40690:49"/>
                  <hi>gouern the Church, and make Eccleſiaſtical lawes, euen in matter of Faith?</hi> Doth it maintain that Catholiks both <hi>rashly</hi> and <hi>obſtinatly</hi> deny to take the oath of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, and by conſequence commit a ſin for not taking it? Doth it ſay the General Councells of Epheſus and Calcedon gaue as much to temporal Princes, and as litle to the Pope of ſpiritual authority, as the oath of Supremacy doth? Doth it ſay that ſom Catholiks hold Generall Councells are fallible? Where will you find in the book of <hi>Queries,</hi> that the Roman Catholik Church hath err'd enormouſly in its principles and practiſes theſe laſt 600. years, and that all the Bishops thereof, are either Traytors to their Princes, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iur'd to the Pope in taking the vſual oath at their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration? Doth the book of <hi>Queries</hi> teach that if Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, as Bishops, help their Soueraigns with money or armes againſt Rebells or Vſurpers, they offend God? As alſo that temporal Soueraings offend God in exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Clergy from their Secular Supreme Courts? Doth the book of <hi>Queries</hi> teach that God may work Miracles to confirm a falshood, or at leaſt the Sanctity of a man who has a good intention and zeale in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it or dying for it, thinking it to be a truth? Or that a man who dyes ſo for maintaining an error, is properly (though not ſtrictly) a Martyr? Or that the whole Church, when it celebrats the feaſt of a Saint as (properly and ſtrictly) a Martvr, may be miſtaken in declaring and belieuing him ſuch a Martyr, though not in belieuing him a Saint in Heauen? All this you maintain (in Saint Thomas of Canterberies caſe) as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequences flowing from the doctrin of your Remonſtrance. Did Bishop <hi>Thomas Deaſe,</hi> nay did <hi>Caron</hi> himſelf, defend theſe hereſies? The book of <hi>Queries</hi> only aſſerted the lawfullneſs of making peace and Confederacies with Proteſtants, and that the Popes
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40690:49"/>
                  <hi>Nuncius</hi> could not validly excommunicat the Irish Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks for doing ſo; and that it was lawfull to appeal to the Pope in thoſe circumſtances, and that the ſaid Appeal did ſuſpend the Nuncius Cenſures. No learned Catholik denyes this doctrin. But not one Catholik in the world doth or can maintain your doctrines now mention'd, and therfore you are not only heretik, but an Impoſtor, pretending that they who oppoſed the Nuntius his Cenſures and practiſes in Ireland, were your Remonſtrants.</p>

The true tranſlation of it is this, <hi>One to be a King; is nothing elſe than to haus
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40690:50"/>Superiority towards Subiects, and that in Subjects there be an obligation of obeying the King.</hi> This you tranſlate thus, <hi>One to be a King is nothing elſe but to haue a politik both di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectiue and coerciue power of Superiority ouer all the people of his Dominions; and that conſequently there be obligation an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable on the ſame people as Subjects to obey him.</hi> Theſe are your words pag. 271. Take my humble aduice Mr. Walſh, and let it be a general rule to you her after; neuer falſify, neuer add words to a <hi>definition,</hi> or Author, wherupon you build the force of your argument; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialy in a matter of ſo great importance as this: For, if you do, moſt men will be tempted to ſay you are a knaue; and if your diſpute be againſt the doctrin and practiſe of the Church, they will add, you are ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinat, that though you ſee the weakneſs of your cauſe, you had rather ſupport it againſt the Church by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting Authors, and abuſing illiterat Readers, than embrace and declare the truth.</p>
               <p>Our Controuerſy with you, Mr. Walſh, is reduced to this point, whether a King deueſts himſelf of his Kingſhip, when he grants to the Clergy, his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, an exemption from his Supreme coerciue power, or from being cited or puniſhed for crimes by his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Supreme Courts of Judicature; but withall leaues them to be cited and puniſhed by Biſhops, or ſom other Spiritual power; which in caſes of Treaſon, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grades the delinquent and deliuers him ouer to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Courts? You ſay, a King doth deueſt himſelf of his Kingſhip by granting ſuch a priuilege to the Clergy. And you proue it by the definition of Kingſhip. But not finding in the definition of Kingſhip any mention of <hi>coercire power,</hi> as if it were eſſential to a King not to diſpenſe in it, or exempt a Subiect from it, you thruſt into the deſinition the word <hi>coerciue power,</hi> and very cleerly conclude from your own forgery that if a King
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40690:51"/>doth exempt any Subiects from it, he doth vnking himſelf as to them, and makes them no Subiects. To be a King Mr. Walſh, as your own friend <hi>Almain</hi> tells you, is to haue a Superiority ouer Subiects, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to haue an obligation of obeying their King. Both are conſiſtent with ſuch an exemption from the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me coerciue ſecular power as the Clergy pretends to.</p>
               <p>You ſay no. Why not? <hi>pag.</hi> 269. <hi>Becauſe the point of Lording, commanding, iudging; punishing, at leaſt in ſom caſes, is the very eſſence of principality; ſo that the Prince can not remit, or quit this, and withall continue Prince.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly you are miſtaken. Do you belieue Mr. Walſh, that God is a Soueraign Prince or Lord of his Angels and Saints in Heauen? This is no impertinent queſtion to one of your principles. If God then be a Soueraign Prince or Lord of his bleſſed Angels and Saints in Heauen, without doubt <hi>Soueraignty</hi> may well ſtand with an exemption from the Soueraigns coerciue power of puniſhing euer, or in any caſe his Subiects; for the Saints in Heauen are Gods ſubiects, and yet by his ſpecial fauor and gratious priuilege are exempted from his ſupreme coerciue power of inflicting euer pain or puniſhment vpon them. If therfore it be not againſt the Diuine Kingſhip or Soueraignty of God, to haue Subiects exempted from his ſupreme coerciue power, I ſee no reaſon why human Kingſhip and Soueraignty, (which is not ſo abſolute, but a ſhadow of the Diuine) may not be conſiſtent with an exemption from the ſupreme human coerciue power, ſure you will grant the Angels and Saints in Heauen are as properly Gods ſubiects, and he (at leaſt) as properly their Soueraign, as any King is of his ſubiects vpon earth. Therfore the nature, notion, and eſſence of <hi>Kingship, Soueraignty,</hi> or Superiority, as ſuch, is conſiſtent with an exemption of the ſubiects from the coerciue power of the Soueraign.</p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:40690:51"/>
               <p>Perhaps you will ſay, That the Saints in Heauen can not ſin, and therfore there can not be any coerciue power in God their King to puniſh them. This, Mr. Walſh, makes nothing for you. Though the Saints in Heauen can not ſin, yet ſtill they are Gods ſubiects, and he their Soueraign; they are exempted from his coerciue power, though his ſubiects. Therfore Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty and ſubiection doth not neceſſarily exclude an exemption in ſubiects from the ſoueraigns ſupreme coerciue power. Let me aſk you an other queſtion. Was the mother of God, or S Iohn Baptiſt, and other Saints, who by a ſingular priuilege were preſerued from ſinning, Gods ſubiects vpon earth? And yet there was no <hi>abſolute</hi> impoſſibility of their not ſinning vpon earth, and by conſequence none of being puniſh'd by Gods coerciue power for ſinning. And yet they were exempt from any ſuch coerciue power vpon earth. Therfore an exemption from coerciue ſupreme power, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſrſtent with ſubiection, and a poſſibility of ſinning.</p>
               <p>Be not ſtartled at this Mr. Walſh, its no new doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin, tis but a ſmale parcel of that ordinary Theology and common ſenſe which you want. I will giue you a reaſon for all this, and you can not deny it without declaring yourſelf an Atheiſt. The proper nature, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and eſſence of Soueraignty or Superiority doth not conſiſt in not exempting ſubiects from a ſupreme or ſuperior coerciue power of puniſhing them, but rather in hauing power to pardon or exempt them, as well as to inflict the puniſhment they haue deſerued, or may deſerue. Nay if you be not very ſtupid, you will eaſily perceiue, that the notion of <hi>exemption</hi> or <hi>priuilege,</hi> inuolues a ſubiection and dependency in the perſon exempted, or priuileg'd as doth <hi>independency, Soueraignty</hi> or <hi>Superiority,</hi> in him that grants it. How then can it be inferr'd from an exemption from a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40690:52"/>coerciue power of Secular Soueraigns granted to their Subiects of the Clergy, that theſe are no Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and they no Soueraigns? Learn a litle wit, Mr. Walſh, and know, that nothing argues greater Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty in a Prince than a power of exempting ſuch of his ſubiects, as he thinks fit from his own ſupreme coerciue power: for that very exemption is ſtill a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency or an argument of their ſubiects dependency and ſubiection, as well as a mark of the Prince his fauor to them. I hope you comprehend now how it was and is in the power of temporal Soueraigns. (Without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſting themſelues of their Kingſhip) to exempt from their own ſupreme coerciue power their ſubiects of the Clergy. You ſay they neuer did ſo <hi>de facto;</hi> that ſhall be now examined.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Mr. Waſh, General rules and obſeruations ought to be well conſidered before they be preſcrib'd; becauſe there are few which admit not of ſom exceptions. But yours is ſo totaly falſe, that you can not name as much as one partioular to giue the leaſt colour of probability
<note n="b" place="bottom">Mr. Walſh his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rule, failing in euery particular.</note>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:40690:54"/>to your vniuerſal propoſition. I challenge you to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me any one Catholik Emperor or Soueraign, that ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed or depoſed any Catholik Biſhop or Prieſt by his own ſole authority, or before they had bin depoſed by the Pope, or other Biſhops. Your inſtance of <hi>S. Athanaſius,</hi> and <hi>Arius</hi> are ridiculous. Was <hi>S. Athanaſius</hi> baniſhed by Conſtantin before the <hi>Tyrian</hi> Synod (ſuch as it was) had depoſed him, and baniſht him alſo from Alexandria? Were not the Arian Biſhops depoſed and baniſht alſo by ſentence of the Nicen Councel, as well as Arius himſelf? Jts true the ſentence was not put in execution, becauſe they ſubmitted and ſubſcribed to the Councells Creed. But yet you ſee how <hi>Socrates</hi> and others tell you, that though <hi>Arius</hi> ſubmitted, yet the Councel reſerued vpon him that part of his ſentence, which baniſht him from his home, <hi>Alexandria.</hi> Was this no coerciue corporal puniſhment inflicted by a ſpiritual power, or by Biſhops as Biſhops? How igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly or diſingeniouſly then do you reprehend <hi>Baronius</hi> in this particular (pag. 347.) That great Annaliſt (as you call him) <hi>knew very well how to diſtinguish twixt a meer eccleſiaſtical, or meerly ſpiritual ſentence of depoſition, and a ciuil imperial ſentence of exile.</hi> Conſtantins ſentence of exile againſt <hi>Arius</hi> was long after this of the Councel, and was but a continuation or confirmation of it as Baronius tells you. Neither did Conſtantin recall A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius from his baniſhment vntill he thought he was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicaly pardon'd or cleer'd and reſtored by the Synod of <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> But why name you not at leaſt the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop whoſe exile by the ſole temporal authority was iudged by the Church for a ſufficient depoſition of ſuch a Biſhop.</p>
               <p>Now Mr. Walſh, I will giue you a general rule or obſeruation, againſt which you can not find any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and it is, that the general practiſe of the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40690:55"/>Church is, <hi>eo ipſo</hi> that a Clergyman is declared an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retik, and therfore depoſed or degraded, in that decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or ſentence is inuolued and vnderſtood exile, impriſonment, or whatſoeuer corporal puniſhment, the lawes preſcribe. This appears by the ancient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of Councells, and true practiſe of the Church; and yourſelf grant it by what you quote (pag. 348.) out of the Councel of Calcedon Act. 4. <hi>Si autem permanſerit turbas faciens, &amp; ſeditiones Eccleſiae, per extraneam poteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, tanquam ſeditionem debere corripi.

God gaue the temporal ſword to Princes, that they may protect his Church, and that is the principal end of their power, and hitherto moſt of the Chriſtian Soueraigns haue employd their power and ſword that way; therfore its neither neceſſary nor decent, that Churchmen ſhould take the ſword out of their hands, or manage it againſt heretiks and Preachers of ſedition. Thats don to their hand. But indeed rather then ſuch an heretik, and ſeditious fellow as you, should paſs without correction, the lay Brothers of your Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (if they had you in any of S. Francis his Conuents) would impriſon and whip you ſoundly; and that (I dare ſay) without offending any one of thoſe temporal Soueraigns you flatter, and would fain perſnade, that if ſuch a ſeditious Friar as you, be corporaly punished by your ſpiritual Superiors; they are in danger of loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their Kingdoms.</p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:40690:55"/>
               <p>And as we grant that the temporal ſword is more properly in the hands of temporal Soueraigns, than of the Clergy, ſo we deny not but that it hath bin a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant cuſtom in the Church to let Treaſon and murther be tryed and iudged by the Princes themſelues, to take away the occaſion of ialouſies, Treaſon being againſt the Princes perſon, and murther ſo horrid a crime, that the Church thinks not fit any way to excuſe, or exempt Clerks who commit them, from the cognizance and ſentence of Secular Courts. This is the reaſon why <hi>S. Athanaſius</hi> when he was faſly accuſed both of treaſon and murther to Conſtantin, was content to leaue the cognizance of thoſe crimes to his Officer <hi>Dalmatius,</hi> as were alſo the Catholik Egyptian Bishops, whoſe words you quote pag. 348. But you thought it not for your purpoſe to quote Conſtantins own words, after that Athanaſius had preſented himſelf before him. The pious Emperor writ to the Bishops of the Prouince of Alexandria, as Athanaſius
<note n="a" place="bottom">Athan. Apol. 2. Theod. lib. 1. c. 17.</note> himſelf, and Theodoret teſtify, theſe words, <hi>Veſtri autem eſt, non mei iudicij, de ea re cognoſcere.

               <p>Mr. Walſh, you are accuſed both of treaſon and murther. Why do you not imitat S. Athanaſius, and cleer yourſelf of both? Why do you not preſent your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before the King,

Sir, all theſe are but calumnies, heer I offer my ſelf to the tryal of both. Why do you not do this Mr. Walsh, if you be innocent? You are very forward in accuſing others, both to the King and Parliament of treaſon; and after your accuſations were found to be meer calumnies, you haue the conſidence to print them in this your bundle of lyes, as truths. But if you ſcruple preſenting yourſelf, as S. Athanaſius did, before the King, or his Lieutenant, me thinks you might imitat that Saint in writing at leaſt an Apology for yourſelf, and confuting the calumny, eſpecialy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing mention'd and complain'd of it in this large volum of yours, wherin you repeat ouer and ouer many of yours own tedious and impertinent ſpeeches.

Sentence being giuen by the Pope and his Collegues in Rome againſt the Donatiſts, and <hi>Caecilianus</hi> by the ſame ſentence declared innocent, the Donatiſts appeal'd from it to the Emperor, who in a rage (for their appealing to him) ſaid, <hi>O rabida furoria audatia!

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40690:57"/>becauſe it was neceſſary to haue an other iudgment, but to giue way to their impudent obſtinacy, reſoluing afterwards to beg pardon of the holy Bishops. The Donatiſts hauing bin caſt alſo in the Councell of Aries, they appeald again to the Emperor, who then vtter'd thoſe remarkable words recorded by <hi>Optatus, Dico enim (vt ſe veritas habet) Sacerdotum indicium ita debet haberi, ac ſi ipſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>This is the truth of the ſtory Mr. Walsh, which you corrupt (pag. 348 &amp; ſeqq.) concealing Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins ſentences and ſentiment of the incompetency of his own iudicature in Eccleſiaſtical matters (related by <hi>Optatus</hi>) and your contradicting Saint Auguſtins plain text, to impoſe <hi>Caluins</hi> ridiculous anſwer conſured by <hi>Belarmin</hi> (and other heretiks errors) vpon ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue you haue ſo much common honeſty and shame, as not to be a wicked falſifier and Forger. <hi>Tis true</hi> (ſay you pag. 349.) <hi>Conſtamin breaks out into this no leſs iuſt than admiring exclamation, O rabidi furoris audacia! ſicut in cauſa Gentilium fieri ſolet, appellationem interpoſuerunt. Yet this imports not, ſignifies not by any means, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantin abominats the ignorance of the Appellants, for hauing, or as if they had againſt any Diuine or human rule or Canon, had recourſe to a lay Tribunal. For had it bin ſo, or had this been the Motiue of his Exclamation, he had diſmiſſed them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them back again to their own proper Epiſcopal Iudges, which yet he did not, but admitted their Appeal. But how euer this be, or what euer moued Conſtantin to this exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the matter of fact which followed, can not be denyed. For ſure
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40690:57"/>enough it is that Conſtantin admitted this appeal.</hi> You add pag. 349. <hi>This admiſsion of the Appeal, and this reexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination by Conſtantin, and by his Councel of Orleans</hi> (you ignorantly miſtake all the way <hi>Orleans</hi> for Arles) <hi>ſeems very harsh to Baronius. And therfore ſayes that Conſtantin was drawn againſt his will to admit ſo vniuſt an Appeal from the iudgment or ſentence of the great Pontiff. But to that of being drawn againſt his will, we haue ſaid before enough, or that there was none could force him. And for his admiſsion</hi> (of the Appeal) <hi>I am ſure Auguſtin neuer reprehends it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I pray Mr. Walſh, did not Conſtantin remit the Donatiſts to <hi>Melchiades</hi> Biſhop of Rome, and thoſe others ioyn'd with him when they appeal to Conſtantin himſelf? Therfore (euen according to your own Confeſſion) the Emperors <hi>admiring Exclamation imports</hi> and <hi>ſignifies</hi> the Appellants ignorance or peruerſneſs in appealing to himſelf, a lay perſon, in eccleſiaſtical affairs. For you confeſs if he did remit them to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal Iudges, that is a ſufficient proof of his repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their appealing to himſelf. <hi>But howeuer this be</hi> (ſay you) <hi>its enough that Conſtantin admitted the Appeal.</hi> How did he admit of it?

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40690:58"/>admit and remit the Donatiſts appeal, after the Pope had condemned them, to the Councel of <hi>Arles?</hi> The Saint tells you in the very next following words, <hi>Non quia iam neceſſe erat, ſed eorum peruerſitatibus cedens, &amp; omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo cupiens tantam impudentiam cohibere.</hi> Are not you then as peruerſe and as impudent as the Donatiſts, when you quote S.

Firſt I do not ſee that Conſtantin delegated or gaue the Pope any power to iudge, but only ſent, other Biſhops to ſit and iudge with him. The vſurping therfore which S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin ſpeakes of heer, is not any vſurpation of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as if the Pope had not any to iudge ſuch matters, without the Emperors delegation, or approbation; but the Emperor hauing bin choſen by the Donatiſts as Arbiter, and not hauing bin excepted againſt by <hi>Caecilianus;</hi> or hauing bin deſired to name Eccleſiaſtical Iudges in this cauſe, it might ſeem to the Donatiſts, that <hi>Melchiades</hi> had thruſt himſelf into a matter, which was with the conſent or permiſſion of both parties to be determined by the Emperors arbitration, or by Iudges which he was deſired to appoint. <hi>Rogatus quippe Imperator Iudices miſit Epiſcopos, qui cum eo ſederent.</hi> But the Emperor ſending theſe Iudges he had appointed to Pope <hi>Melchiades,</hi> and bidding them ioyn in iudgment with him, is not to giue authority of iudging to the Pope, but rather to confirm by the Papal authority the Biſhops iudgment. And therfore S. Auguſtin had reaſon to tell the Donatiſts, the Pope did neither vſurp any authority, or intermedle in their controuerſy offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly without hauing bin appeald to, or without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſired by the Emperor, to whom they had remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both the matter, and the manner of deciding it.</p>

               <p>The ſame practiſe of the Donatiſt Biſhops recurring

               </p>
               <p>Is it the part of a Chriſtian writer, Mr. Walſh, to impoſe vpon his Readers ſuch falshoods as you do, and then vpon that great Doctor of the Church Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin? This great Doctor writ that Epiſtle 48. to proue it was lawfull for Churchmen to implore the protection and help of ſecular Princes, and the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their lawes againſt heretiks and ſchiſmatiks (but not their Iudicature) as is euident by the text. And becauſe <hi>Rogatus</hi> and other Donatiſts, reprehended the Saint for changing his former opinion into this which he now defended, he retorts their arguments, and puts them in mind of the ancient Donatiſts practiſes againſt <hi>Caecilian;</hi> ſhewing how inconſequently and abſurdly they argued againſt the puniſhment of conuicted here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Biſhops by ſecular lawes, whereas themſelues made the Secular Soueraigns Iudges of <hi>Caecilianus</hi> and <hi>Felix,</hi> Catholik and innocent Biſhops. This being the whole drift of S. Auguſtin in that epiſtle, you quote ſom words of it, which, euen as you order them, make againſt you. For euen in them the Saint taxes the ancient Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts with <hi>preſumption,</hi> for accuſing <hi>Caetilianus</hi> (though he were criminal) before a Secular Iudge; and you pretend, Saint Auguſtin only reprehended their enuy and malitious intention in accuſing him, but not the accuſation itſelf If you had don your Reader the fauor, and Saint Auguſtin the iuſtice, to quote his words but foure lines after thoſe, you would haue cleer'd the whole matter, and not haue forc't me to call you a ſhameleſs Impoſtor.

This is your Idea, and you ſay it was the ſentiment of Saint Cyprian, if you be not much miſtaken, and that Conſtantin the great had it from his writings, and aduiſed the Biſhops of the Nicen Councel (according to this Idea) to fall vpon the Arians, and neuer trouble themſelues with repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending or correcting their own faults and frailties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all ſuch things muſt be remitted to the day of Iudgment; in the mean time euery <hi>Bishop hath his own proper abitrement, pro licentia libertatis &amp; poteſtatis ſuae, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the pleaſure of his own liberty and his own power.</hi> I confeſs this is a great priuilege, and more than euer the Roman Catholik Clergy (euen the Pope himſelf) prerended to: for the Pope may be vnpoped, at leaſt for hereſy. But the Biſhops of your Idea, or Church, Mr. Walſh, are all Popes, and yet can not be declared by any other Biſhops or Cardinals to be depoſed by Chriſt for any hereſy or fault committed in gouerning their flocks. Now, though you declare yourſelf to be no Roman Catholik by this your parity of all Biſhops, and ſaying that <hi>(by the immediat law of God)</hi> the Pope hath no ſpiritual ſuperiority or authority ouer other Bishops; yet I hope you will giue temporal Soueraigns a ſuperintendence, or ſom power to keep thoſe inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Bishops in order, and Church diſciplin; at leaſt you pretended ſo hitherto. But now you ſay, <hi>no.</hi> For, Conſtantin and Saint Cyprians rule is, that no Emperor, no King, none but Jeſus Chriſt alone may order or iudge Bishops: <hi>Vnus &amp; ſolus (Ieſus Chriſtus)

And yea you haue read all whateuer hath bin to the contrary obiected by the Roman Catholik writers, whether againſt the matter or form, or want of power in the Conſecraters, by reaſon of their Schiſm or hereſy, or of their being depoſed formerly from their ſees.</hi> By the way Mr. Walsh, let me tell you, that the Roman Catholik Church doth not ground its practiſe of ordaining <hi>(abſolutely and without any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all)</hi> proteſtant Miniſters, who are conuerted and deſire to be Prieſts amongſt vs, vpon their want of true and valid ordination proceeding from any Schiſm,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40690:65"/>hereſy, or depoſition of their Ordainers, and firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Bishops; for, we all grant that neither Schiſm, nor hereſy of the Conſecraters, or their <hi>depoſition,</hi> makes an Ordination inualid; as you ſee by what we hold of heretical Biſhops but we ground the nullity of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Epiſcopacy and ordination both vpon the inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of the proteſtant <hi>form</hi> of Epiſcopacy &amp; prieſtood, and vpon their firſt Conſecrater (Parker) (vpon whoſe conſecration all theirs doth depend) neuer hauing bin conſecrated a Bishop himſelf; for, (beſides many other proofs) <hi>Iewel</hi> and <hi>Horn</hi> pretending to make out his and their own Epiſcopal conſecration, could neuer in their bookes printed to that purpoſe, and in anſwer to <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> and <hi>Stapletons</hi> printed bookes and queſtions, name then (when it concern'd them moſt) the Bishop that conſecrated Parker; nor produce as much as one wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſo publik and ſolemn a Conſecration as his was pretended to be 50 years after. This together with the 25. article of the Church of England, declaring, that <hi>Ordination</hi> is not properly a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> becauſe it requires no <hi>viſible ſign</hi> or <hi>ceremony</hi> (and by conſequence no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Epiſcopal hands) together with the Act of Parliament 8. Eliz. 1. is one of the chief grounds we haue to belieue the Proteſtant Bishops are not validly conſecrated, nor the Catholiks guilty of ſacriledge in reordaining them, when they are made Prieſts amongſt vs.</p>
               <p>An other ground is the inualidity of the proteſtant <hi>Form</hi> for ordaining Prieſts and Bishops; the <hi>Form</hi> I mean that had bin vſed ſince King Eduard 6. reign vntill the hapy reſtauration of King Charles 2 For, after his reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauration, the Bishops themſelues found our excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt the validity of King Eduards <hi>Form,</hi> were reaſonable, and therupon were pleaſed to alter it adding therunto the words <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Pruſt,</hi> as we directed;

               <p>But to return to Conſtantin and Cyprian, I can aſſure you, that you are very much deceiued (or at leaſt you deſign to deceiue others) in the interpretation you giue of their words. Its generaly belieued that S. Auguſtin vnderſtood Saint Cyprians works and words better than you do, Mr. Walsh. Now Saint Auguſtin after ſetting down lib. 3. de Baptiſino cap. 3. thoſe words of Saint Cyprian which you quote for the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40690:66"/>of Biſhops, as if none of them ought to be iudged by an other, but only by God &amp;c. Sayes, that S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian meant this of Controuerſies, wherin the Church hath not declared or defined the truth as yet in debate, <hi>Opinor</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in his quaeſtionibus quae nondum eliquatiſsima perſpectione diſcuſſae ſunt, &amp;c.</hi> Jn ſuch queſtions t'is very certain that not only Biſhops in Prouincial and Gene-Councils, but that euery priuat Doctor in the Schools, may ſpeake freely, and not be forc't to any ſide or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; and this is all that S.

Cyprian was alſo in the right, in telling his African Biſhops, that neither himſelf, nor any of them, was <hi>Epiſcopus Epiſcopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, Bishop of Bishops.</hi> That is a title giuen only to the Biſhop of Rome, and hath bin giuen by a Primat of Afrik, and Saint Cyprians ſucceſſor (Stephen) in his letter to Pope <hi>Damaſus;</hi> in a letter, I ſay, writ to him in the name of three African Councils; <hi>Beatiſsimo Domino, &amp; Apoſtolico culmine ſublimato, S.

               <p>Now to end with your <hi>Idea</hi> of the Church. It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in the liues of ſuch Saints as are Fundators or Reformers of Regular Orders, that God did reueale to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40690:67"/>them, or giue them an <hi>Idea</hi> of their Congregations. Was it God or the Deuil gaue you the <hi>Idea</hi> of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation? yourſelf is much pleaſed with it; but the Catholiks to whom you communicate and dedicate it, haue no reaſon to be pleaſed with it.

How can you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mr. Walſh, that Chriſt, being infinit wiſdom, would inſtitute a Commonwealth of frail men, or a Church and not inueſt the Gouernors therof (who are the Clergy) with any coerciue power to puniſh and correct ſuch frailties of their ſheep or ſubiects, as he foreſaw would be committed, and corrupt others? This is a pretty Idea of your Church, but not of Chriſts. An Idea your Remonſtrants did practiſe whilſt you were in power, and gouernd them, but too ſcandalous to continue.</p>

               <p>You haue the misfortune Mr. Walſh, to contradict yourſelf in euery ſtory you tell, and by conſequence you haue a ſpecial gift of diſcrediting your own wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and making your relation and comments vpon it incredible and ridiculous. You ſay in the beginning of this ſtory, that <hi>Arcadius</hi> receiued the accuſations againſt Saint Iohn Chryſoſtom, and therupon, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing firſt ordered a iudicial procedure againſt that holy Biſhop, at laſt condemned and ſent him with a guard of Soldiers farr off to exiſe. A <hi>iudicial procedure,</hi> Mr. Walſh, is, to proceed <hi>ſecundum allegata &amp; probata;</hi> if Arcadius did ſo, and was Chryſoſtoms lawfull Iudge Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> could not reprchend <hi>Arcadius</hi> as procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vniuſtly againſt him, or ſay that he condemned him <hi>re non iudicata.</hi> Js to condemn one according to a iudicial procedure, and by a lawfull authority, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him <hi>re non iudicata?</hi> When therfore the Pope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended Arcadius for baniſhing Chryſoſtom <hi>re non
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:40690:71"/>iudicata?</hi> before his cauſe was ſentene't, he meant (as is vnderſtood by euery man of ſenſe) that Arcadius was not his lawfull Iudge, and that he ought to haue expected the ſentence of the Apoſtolik ſea, or a Catholik Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Biſhops to which the Saint had appeald? You ſee Mr. Walſh, how you contradict yourſelf, and how difficult a thing it is to contradict truth, and to corrupt ſuch Authors as tell it, without being caught in a lye.</p>
               <p>Heare then the true ſtory of S. Iohn <hi>Chtyſoſtoms</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſy with the Emperor <hi>Arcadius,</hi> as it is related by S. Iohn himſelf, Palladius, and the ſame Authors which you quote. <hi>Theophilus</hi> Biſhop of Alexandria, and others ill affected to S. Iohn Chryſoſtom, were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd by <hi>Eudoxia</hi> the Empreſs to depoſe that holy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat from his ſee, his chief Accuſers were ſom of his own Prieſts, who could not endure his iuſt reprehenſions for their faults. Amongſt other things himſelf ſayes, he was accuſed of too much familiarity with a certain woman, and that he permitted people to receiue the communion after eating. This accuſation was heard by <hi>Theophilus,</hi> and 36. Biſhops of his and the Empreſs fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, met at <hi>Calcedon;</hi> and exhibited by two Prieſts of Conſtantinople, which Chryſoſtom had excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated for notorious crimes. The Saint had with him in Conſtantinople forty Biſhops aſſembled to heare a charge of 70. articles giuen in againſt Theophilus; but Thophilus who ſhould haue ſtood at the bair in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, ſate as a Iudge in <hi>Calcedon,</hi> and without any lawfull authority ſummon'd Chryſoſtom to appeare before him at Calcedon, to anſwer the charge put in againſt him by the two excommunicated Prieſts. But though the S. ſaid he would appeare when ſoeuer the Iudges were lawfull and not parties, yet the 40. Biſhops who ſtuck to him, ſignified to Theophilus, that he ſhould rather com to Conſtantiuople, to cleer himſelf,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:40690:71"/>than call others to iudgment at Chalcedon? Vpon this Chryſoſtom had ſentence of depoſition paſt vpon him at Chalcedon, for contumacy forſooth. And though he appeald to a Councell of Catholik and indiſterent Biſhops, yet thoſe of Chalcedon had ſo much intereſt with the Empreſs, and ſhee with the Emperor, as to haue Chryſoſtom halled out of his Church by Soldiers; wherupon he retired to <hi>Bernetum</hi> of Bithinia. But a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition being feared in Conſtantinople for this iniuſtice, the Emperor (and the Empreſs alſo) ſent to deſire him to return withall diligence; which he did; but as ſoon as he return'd, he deſired the Emperor (as may be ſeen in his Epiſtle to Pope Innocent) that his cauſe might be tryed in a lawfull Synod of Biſhops; ſo farr was he from acknowledging the Emperor to be lawfull Iudge either of his cauſe, or of his baniſhment.</p>
               <p>Som months after Chryſoſtoms return, he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the ſportes and playes which were acted almoſt at the Church door, with ſo much profaneſs and noyſe, that the Diuine ſeruice and Sermons could ſcarce be heard. But becauſe this ſtirr was kept in honor of the Empreſs <hi>Endoxia,</hi> and at her ſtatue, which was ſet vp neer the Church vpon a noble pillar, ſhe interpreted Chryſoſtoms zeal to be but animoſity againſt herſelf, and ſent priuatly for thoſe Bishops which had formerly condemned and depoſed him at Chalcedon, to the end they might renew or confirm that ſentence, or any other by virtue wherof he might be depoſed and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished. They finding no crime wherupon to ground his depoſition, pretended it was a ſufficient cauſe for it, that hauing bin lately depoſed by themſelues in their Synod of Calcedon, he return'd to take poſſeſſion of his ſee without the ſentence of an other Synod greater than that which had depoſed him; alleaging this to be againſt a <hi>Canon</hi> made in a Councell of <hi>Antioch.</hi> But the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:40690:72"/>Saint replyed, it was a Canon made by ſom Arian Bish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops, againſt S. Athanaſius, and therfore of no force. Heerupon the aforſaid Bishops and <hi>Eudoxia</hi> importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Emperor <hi>Arcadius</hi> to banish Chryloſtom, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him that their ſentence therof was iuſt, taking vpon their own ſouls the ſin and blame therof. The Emperor at their inſtance ſent a Meſſage to Chryſoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, to be gon; but he anſwering that he had receiued the charge of that Church from God, to procure the ſaluation of ſouls, and therefore could not leaue it vnleſs he were forc't away, the Emperor ſent ſoldiers to do it. Then Chryſoſtom appeald to Pope Innocent the firſt, vſing theſe words. <hi>I beſeech you write, and by your authority decree, that theſe wicked tranſactions be of no force, as of their own nature they are voyd and null, we hauing bin abſent, and not refuſing iudgment; thoſe who haue don them, make them ſubiect to the Cenſure of the Church.

                  <hi>Arcadius</hi> writ a ſubmiſſiue letter to the Pope, excuſing himſelf, and laying all the blame vpon the Bishops and <hi>Eudoxia,</hi> ſaying he was ignorant of their iniuſtice againſt Chryſoſtom, therfore beg'd that himſelf and <hi>Eudoxia</hi> (who he ſaid was ſick, and had bin ſeuerely reprehended by him) might be abſoluted from his Holineſs Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. The Pope accepting of this excuſe and ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, reſtored them both to the Eccleſiaſtical commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. This is the true ſtory of S. Iohn Chryſoſtom, out of which Mr. Walsh, you may gather 1. That <hi>Areadius</hi> did not as much as pretend to be Iudge of S. Iohn Chryſoſtom, or of his cauſe. 2. That neither the Saint nor the Pope, nor euen the factious Bishops who met at Chalcedon, pretended there was any power in the Emperor to iudge or ſentence the perſon, or cauſe of Iohn, but only to banish him purſuant to the ſentence of the Conuenticle of Calcedon, who took vpon themſelues the ſin of that action, at which the Emperor ſcrupled as you haue heard. 3. That when the Emperor commanded Iohn to be gon from his Church, the Saint would not obey him, as not being his Iudge; and therfore the ſoldiers forc't him away. Would ſuch a great Saint as this, haue diſobeyed, if he thought the Emperor had any lawfull power or iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature ouer him in that matter?</p>
               <p>It were an endleſs and ſuperfluous labor to follow this wild Friar, wandring vp and down the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory with ſo litle iudgment, that though he can not find therin any thing for his purpoſe, yet is ſure all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to fix vpon thoſe examples which make moſt
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:40690:73"/>againſt him, as we haue ſeen hitherto, and any one may ſee in his own book, wherin he inſtances half a dozen other Princes actions, ſom wherof were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd heretiks, as <hi>Theodoricus</hi> the Arrian, <hi>This Prince, though an Arian</hi> (ſaith the iudicious Friar pag. 357.) <hi>as to his belief of the Trinity of perſons, or Diuinity of Ieſus Chriſt, yet in all other points of Chriſtian Religion —, he was preciſe, wary, and ſtrict enough.</hi> Its very likely a man who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the Trinity and the Diuinity of Chriſt, would be very preciſe in belieuing, and ſtrict in not violating the Clergyes Priuileges. The Catholik Princes did but execute the laws againſt Bishops, when theſe were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and declared heretiks by the Church; and that, ſomtimes at the expreſs petition of the Popes or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells themſelues; and yet this dull Friar thinks this is a confeſſion and acknowledgment of the Clergyes ſubiection in ſpiritual matters to temporal Soueraigns, as Iudges therof.

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:40690:73"/>Walsh, would you haue the Pope ſpeake nonſenſe like yourſelf? Would you haue him exhort the Emperor to remoue from his mind the Popes thoughts, or a papal condemnation? What would you be at? The Pope deſires the Emperor to be charitable, and to be recoucil'd to the Church. Is this to acknowledge in him a full, <hi>proper, legal,</hi> and ſupreme power of coercion of Clerks? write ſenſe Mr. Walsh, and beg pardon of the prinrer and Reader, for your book is a manifeſt nuyſance to common ſenſe.</p>

Belarmin ſayes he did it, as Hermanus was a Prince of the Empire, and not as he was a Bishop. To this you ſay (pag. 264.) That <hi>Belarmine writes ſo of this matter as he may be refuted</hi> with that <hi>Ieer,</hi> 
                  <q>wherwith a certain <hi>Boor</hi> pleaſantly check'd a great Bishop, as he, rode by with a ſplendid pompous train. The ſtory is, that a Countrey clown hauing firſt admired, and ſaid, this pomp was very vnlyke that of the Apoſtles, to whom Bishops did ſucceed; and ſom of the Bishops train anſwering, that this Bishop was not only a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of the Apoſtles, but alſo Heir to a rich Lordship; and that moreouer he was a Duke, and a Prince too; the Clown replyed, but if God (ſayes he) condemn, the Duke and Prince to eternal fire, what will becom, of the Bishop? Euen ſo doth Belarmin write (as that ſeauant ſpoke) that this Hermanus, whom Charles 5. ſummon'd to appeare, was not only an Archbishop, but a Prince alſo of the Empire. And euen ſo do I ſay,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:40690:74"/>and reply with the Countrey ſwain, when the Emperor iudg'd the Prince of the Empire, did he not, I pray, iudge the Archbishop too? But you will ſay, that though indeed he iudg'd the Archbishop, yet not as an Archbishop, but as a Prince of the Empire. Let it be ſo; for neither do I intend or mean (or at leaſt vrge, or preſs now) that Clerks, as Clerks, are ſubiect to the coercion or direction of Kings; but as men, but as Cittizens, and politik parts of the body politik; which Kind of authority, as Belarmin confeſſes, Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les 5. both acknowledged and vindicated to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Walsh, if <hi>Bèlarmín</hi> doth confeſs (as indeed he doth) that Clerks as men and Cittizens, are ſubiect to the coerciue power and ſecular iudicature of temporal Soueraigns, doth it follow, that the Soueraigns can not exempt them as they are Clergymen from that very coerciue power and ſecular iudicature? Heer you grant they are exempted as Clerks from it, though in other places of your book you ſay its impoſſible they should be exempted, vnleſs their Soueraigns ceaſe to be Soueraigns. I wish you did exempt and free your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from theſe contradictions. Indeed your ſtory of the <hi>Countrey ſwain,</hi> doth ſufficiently conuince us of your great erudition, but me thinks the application doth not ſo cleerly shew your incomparable acuteneſs. You take the <hi>material</hi> man ſomwhat toogroſſely. You, who are a <hi>Scotiſt,</hi> should be better at your <hi>formal</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions, and conſider in a man the <hi>form</hi> or quality of a <hi>Clerk,</hi> or <hi>Churchman,</hi> as raiſing him a degree aboue the natural or <hi>material</hi> manhood, and common ſort of mankind. Saint Peter was more ſubtile; he call'd the Prieſtood <hi>Regale Sacerdotium.</hi> Not that the ſpiritual ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>Prieſthood</hi> or <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> changes mans nature, but his quality; it places the perſon in a higher ranck, than
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:40690:74"/>naturally he could arriue vnto. Euen in human Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (as ſuch) you may ſee this metaphyſical diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion explain'd. A <hi>Peer</hi> of the Realm is a man, and as a man ought to be tryed by a common iury; but his <hi>Peerage</hi> exempts him from that ordinary way of trial; and yet he is ſtill a man, and can not, euen as a man, be tryed by twelue <hi>Commoners,</hi> but by his Peers. Jf the example of Subiects will not ſatisfy you, conſider that of Soueraigns. Our ancient Kings of England did ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the ancient Kings of France, as Dukes of of Normandy, Aquitain &amp;c. You will not deny they were men, both as Kings and Dukes, and did homage as men. Doth it follow, that becauſe they were men, and did homage as men, they muſt needs do homage as Kings? Or doth it follow that the King of France could not (out of his reſpect to their Kingship) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt them euen as Dukes of Normandy and men, from the ſupreme coerciue power of his Courts? Would this vnking the French Kings? I haue proued this to be conſiſtent with Soueraignty and ſubiection, in the 9. Animaduerſion, to which I remit you, if you vnderſtand not as yet how the ſame man may be priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and puniſh'd vpon different ſcores. What the Clown ſaid, is very true, if God condemns the Bishop, as he is a Prince, to hell fire, he muſt go thither alſo as he is a Biſhop; yet there is this comfort left to Biſhops who are Princes, God will neuer ſend them thither for maintaining the iuſt priuileges either of a Prince or Bish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op; but for ſom mortal ſin vnrepented; for which there is no priuilege or exemption.</p>
               <p>I haue heard your ſtory of the Biſhop and Prince told otherwiſe, viz that the Biſhop lying a dying, the Deuil appear'd to him (as ſom think he doth to all men in that paſſage) and tempting him to deſpair, ſaid, he had don ſuch and ſuch things, which were not ſutable
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:40690:75"/>to his Epiſcopal function. The Biſhop anſwer'd, he did not do thoſe things, as a Biſhop, but as a temporal Prince. To this the Deuil reply'd, I am a dull Deuil, and can not vnderſtand well thoſe ſubtile diſtinctions, <hi>as a Prince,</hi> and <hi>as a Bishop,</hi> therfote I will carry you to hell as you are ſuch a man, and as I find you, without queſtioning whether you go as a Prince or as a Biſhop. I feare Mr. Walsh, this will be your fate. You will meet with ſom dull Deuil, one as dull as yourſelf, a Deuil that knowes not how to diſtinguiſh between Peter Walſh the Procurator, and Peter Walſh the Friar. He muſt be a very acute Deuil that can find out any <hi>formality</hi> or diſtinction to excuſe your actings, either as Procurator, or Friar. As Procurator you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayd your truſt, and acted quite contrary to your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; and as a Friar you ought not to haue taken any without your Superiors leaue. Therfore you being neither Prince, Biſhop, nor lawfull Procurator, but a poor ſimple Franciſcan Friar, ſuppoſe the Deuil had met you when you ſet out from <hi>Dublin,</hi> well mounted (and much finer, I belieue, in cloathes and ribands, than the Bishop your Countrey ſwain was ſo much ſcandalized at) and attended to ſearch after thoſe poor ſoules that hid themſelues from your perſecution, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I ſay, the Deuil ſhould meet you, and endeauor to hurry you with him to hell; how could you find out any pretext to excuſe, your perſecution, your dreſs, retinue, and equipage? Was not euery Countrey Clown or <hi>ſwain</hi> that ſaw it, ſcandalized? Did not a certain Lady obiect to you, that S. Francis neuer wore ſuch cloathes, or trauell'd ſo; much leſs perſecuted Prieſts? You obiect againſt F. <hi>Netteruille</hi> in your book, that he wore a ſword in Dublin an. 1666. If he did, I belieue it was to diſguiſe his caracter, and out of reſpect to the gouernment; and I am ſure it was no ſyluer

You were and are ſtill a priuiledged perſon, becauſe you ſent the poor Prieſts to priſon, and when you could giue no legal cauſe for it, you ſaid, They were Priſoners of ſtate. But that circumſtance of Father Netteruille putting his hand to his ſword, and ſaying he would neuer take it from his ſide, vntill he ſaw the french King, is not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, though you auerr it very poſitiuely. Jt would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commode him very much in his long iourney; and none would be more ſurpriſed at a religious mans wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a ſword in France, than the French King; neither would ſuch an vnneceſſary diſguiſe be the way for F. <hi>Netterinlle</hi> to make his Court to him.</p>
               <p>But the Deuil will not in the laſt hour inueigh ſo much againſt you for your ſword, or the fineneſs of your dreſs, as for the foulneſs of your ſoul, your perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, your treaſons, and your hereſies. Theſe are damnable, whether in a Biſhop, Prince, or Friar. Your pretended Procuratorſhip for the Iriſh Clergy (which is the only excuſe you pretend for your actings) can not warrant ſuch crimes. Will you ſay at the hour of your death to Satan, when he charges you with your irregularities, that you acted not as a Friar, but as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator of thoſe few Clergymen who commiſſion'd you, and you confeſs my Lord of Ormond check't you ſoundly for ſpeaking in their behalf? will you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Deuil when he charges you with your extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Caſtle of Kilkenny from the Kings party, to deliuer it to the <hi>Nuncius,</hi> that you committed not that treaſon as Friar Walſh, but as Procurator Walſh? He will reply, and proue you did it as Friar Walſh, and in your Franciſcan habit, by virtue of an Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion written and fixt by your own hand. Will you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the Deuil, that you ioyn'd with D. <hi>Enos</hi> in his infamous libel againſt the peace of 46, as Procurator
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:40690:76"/>Walſh, when you ruin'd the Kings intereſt, his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants credit, and the Iriſh Nation? He will grant, you acted as Procurator, but as the Deuils Procurator; and will ſhew your approbation of the libel in print in the firſt page therof; and beſides will proue the truſt the Nuntius repoſed in you, and how he ioyn'd you in a <hi>Comittee,</hi> at that very time with the ſame D.

Why did not you oppoſe and quaſh alſo (ſeing you were in ſuch truſt and power) a greater miſchief, the Formulary and excommunication yourſelf drew and writ for wreſting the Caſtle of Kilkenny out of the Kings hands? and your own approbation of D. <hi>Enos</hi> his libel? Will you pretend you acted as <hi>Procurator</hi> Walſh, and not as <hi>Friar</hi> Walſh, when you ſtruck vp with your Impoſtor Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary (as your ſelf terms him) to cheate the King and his Subiects of Money by a forged Commiſſion of the Pope? and when your Remonſtrant brethren went vp and down the Countrey impoſing and raiſing a Tax and ſumms of money, wherwith you and they made good cheere, and were ſo often merry at the ſign of the Harp and Croun in Oxmontown? Did you draw vp your Impoſtor Commiſſioners Inſtructions to his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitators and Collectors (who were your Remonſtrants) as <hi>Friar</hi> Walſh, or as <hi>Procurator</hi> Walſh? This and much more will the Deuil obiect againſt you. What will you anſwer?

               <p>You return to the Emperor Charles the 5. and (pag. 265.) <hi>muſt tell the Defenders of Belarmin,</hi> that <hi>Spondanus</hi> in his continuation of <hi>Baronius</hi> his Annals and an. 1545. ſayes, Charles did ſummon the aforeſaid <hi>Hermannus</hi> of Colen to the Diet of <hi>Worms</hi> at the inſtance of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and Vniuerfity of <hi>Colen,</hi> for introducing hereſy into it by the aduice of <hi>Buter; and therfore</hi> (ſay you) <hi>this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror ſummond that Archbishop, euen as an Archbishop.</hi> Why ſo Mr. Walſh? Might not the Emperor ſummon him as an Elector, or as a temporal Prince, for introducing hereſy into the Empire, or into an Imperial Town? Can not a temporal Prince be guilty of ſuch a fault as well as a Prelat? But if you will needs haue Charles the 5. to be an Infringer of the Eccleſiaſtical immunities, our anſwer is, that he might do ſo <hi>de facto,</hi> but not <hi>de iure;</hi> and that therin he offended God very grieuouſly. Som ſay his renuntiation of the Empire, and his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, proceeded from the particular ſenſe of that ſin (if he was guilty of it) and that the ſcruple of the Biſhops of <hi>Segouia's</hi> death made him bury himſelf aliue in a litle Cell of the Monaſtery of <hi>Sancta Iuſta.</hi> Had the Iudge who executed that cruelty bin ſo penitent as the Emperor, he might haue bin as happy. But perhaps he exceeded his Commiſſion, becauſe I know not of any other proof that the Emperor conſented to the Biſhops murther, but that he neuer queſtion'd the murtherer. The ſtory is this, the Biſhop of Segouia, a popular Prelat in Spain, hauing bin almoſt as actiue in the rebellion of the Commoners of that Kingdom againſt Charles the 5. as you Mr. Walſh in the reiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Iriſh peace of 1646. vnder the pretence of a viſit (becauſe it was difficult to put him to death pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blikly) was ſtrangled in his own Pallace and Chamber by Iudge <hi>Ronquillo,</hi> deputed by the Emperor to inquire after, and puniſh the Heads of that Rebellion. This
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:40690:77"/>clandeſtin execution, and open breach of Eccleſiaſtical immunity, occaſion'd the vſual Cenſures of the Church againſt <hi>Ronquillo,</hi> who (perhaps being of your opinion, Mr. Walſh, in this matter) took litle notice of the Cenſures; but in his laſt ſickneſs he begd the fauor of King Philip the ſecond of Spain, to honor him with his preſence, becauſe he had ſom thing to communicat to his Majeſty of great importance for his ſeruice. The King was pleaſed to grant him his requeſt. His buſineſs was to tell him, that he had ſerued his Father Charles 5. very faithfully, in putting the Biſhop of Segouia to Death with ſo litle ceremony; therfore to ſtop his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries obloquies againſt that action, he beſeecht his Majeſty to own and iuſtify the Act; and then he would dye contented. The King anſwer'd it was don in his Father's reign, and that he might ſhew his Fathers Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, if he gaue him any to do it; and ſo aduiſing him to make his peace with God, the King left him; and <hi>Ronouillo</hi> dyed, and was buried in the Church of a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Conuent in Madrid.</p>

Whether your oppoſing the lawfullneſs of the Eccleſiaſtical Immunities will incline you to doubt of this matter of fact, generally belieued, and frequently printed in Spain, without the leaſt contradiction, I can not tell; but I am ſure you can haue no reaſon to queſtion a thing confirm'd by the ſight and teſtimony of a numerous Community of religious, who liued by burying the dead; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore againſt whoſe intereſt it was, to publiſh what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd in their own Church, and to one of their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors. Som of theſe religious were liuing when you
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:40690:77"/>were in Spain, and repeated to as many as deſired it of them, what I ſhall now relate.</p>
               <p>That very night wherin <hi>Ronquillo's</hi> body was buried in their Church, about midnight one rung the <hi>Porteria</hi> Bell, and rapt ſo furiouſly at the door of the Conuent, that the Porter reprehended the extrauagancy and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience: but aſking what the matter was, and who they were; (for he ſaw two) they anſwer'd they were Miniſters of Gods iuſtice, which they came to execute in that houſe by the Diuine Majeſties command; they bid him open the door immediatly, otherwiſe they would find a way to do it themſelues. The Porter gaue an account to the Superior of what he had ſeen and heard; the Superior aſſembled all the Fathers, who were (at the vſual houre) preparing to ſing Matins in the quire; they all, much frighted with the Meſſage and the noiſe, which ſtill continued at the door, reſolued to go in proceſſion thither, to examin the matter, euery Friar confeſſing, and preparing himſelf for death, not knowing but that thoſe Meſſingers might be ſent for himſelf. The door being opend, the Superior aſkt the two perſons, who they were and what was their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? They anſwer'd, we are Gods Miniſters of iuſtice, and come to execute his command. The Superior told them, that Conuent was Gods houſe, and therfore it was fit to obey his Orders. Then the fellows bid the Fathers go to the Church, where the bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had bin taken out of the <hi>Sacrarium</hi> and in the <hi>Ciborium</hi> ſet vpon the Altar; they followed the Fathers, and when they came to the Church, made a low bow towards the bleſſed Sacrament, and bid the Fathers go towards the graue of <hi>Ronquillo,</hi> who had bin buried that euening: One of the two, touching the great Marble ſtone that lay vpon the graue, remoued the ſame without any difficulty; the other took vp <hi>Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillo's</hi>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:40690:78"/>body, and bid one of the Fathers bring the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borium</hi> from the Altar to receiue in it the bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which that wretch had vnworthily receiued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dyed; and the Friar holding it before the mouth of the Corps, he that took <hi>Ronquillo</hi> out of the graue, ſtruck him on the back, and the particle fell into the <hi>Ciborium,</hi> without any coaruption, or change of the ſpecies. Then both thoſe Miniſters of Gods iuſtice told the Fathers, they were ſent by his Diuine Majeſty to carry that body into hell, where the ſoul expected it; and ſudenly they and the body vaniſht. All attributed this manifeſtation of Gods iudgment, to <hi>Ronquillo's</hi> breach of the Eccleſiaſtical immunity, and to his contempt of the Cenſures therupon enſuing. Let this example be a warning for you Mr. Walſh; if God wrought ſuch a Miracle as this, to diſcountenance your doctrin, againſt a raſh act of a lay Iudge, wherunto he was tempted by feare perhaps of looſing his employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or for being too forward in his Princes ſeruice, what iudgments ought not you (a Churchman and a Friar) to feare, euen in this world, for willfully main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that temporal Soueraigns do ſin, and dethrone themſelues if they grant or make good to the Clergy thoſe priuileges and monuments of piety, wherby Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are iuſtly ſtiled Protectors and nurſing Fathers of Gods Church; and wherin conſiſts the greateſts glory of their renowned Anceſtors?</p>
               <p>I haue don Mr. Walſh, and beg your pardon for the harſhneſs of my language, though in a cauſe and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances wherin it would be a crime to be more ciuil to ſuch an Aduerſary as you. I defend the doctrin of the Church, together with the right of temporal Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns, and the dignity of Biſhops againſt the virulent paſſion and bitter pen of a barbarous Friar; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it would be as ridiculous to treat you with cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:40690:78"/>in this occaſion, as it would be blameable in any other, not to giue you the reſpect due to a gentleman. You ſay you are one, I belieue, and partly know you are: but if you were not, I ſhould honor your habit more than your extraction. Jt is a ſad misfortune, that I muſt not regard either, and that the ſame habit which might iuſtly challenge reſpect for him that weares it, muſt be made your greateſt reproach, and iuſtify the contempt of your perſon. The obligations of a gentleman, and of a Seraphik Regular, which you haue ſo notoriouſly violated, makes me vſe violence againſt my nature and inclination, whenſoeuer I am ſeuere vpon you. I haue a great affection for your perſon Mr. Walſh, and am ſory I can not as yet expreſs it in other tearms. As I am a defender of the Church, and you an Aduerſary of the ſame, I can not conceal the wayes wherby you abuſe the illiterat ſort of people, and muſt in plain engliſh ſay, you are a Cheat. But if you and I euer meet, and diſcourſe as priuat perſons, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out relation to our Churches, you ſhall find me as ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil an Admirer of thoſe few good qualities you yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, as I now am a publik Cenſurer of your errors. We are Countreymen, we are neighbors Children, we are old acquaintance, we haue bin bred together, all our Anceſtors haue bin Roman Catholiks, our Relations are ſtill ſo, and you pretend to be and continue one. Why then ſhould we fall out irreconciliably? Let vs therfore be friends; but firſt you muſt be reconciled to the Church, and to the Superiors of your Order. I haue no particular pike to yourſelf, all my quarell is againſt your book, and I belieue few writers will be more moderat, than I againſt your opinions, when any takes the pains to conſider them.</p>
               <p>All I can ſay to excuſe you is, that you writ as you thought, or rather as you imagin'd. Yow know the

Your diſeaſe Mr. Walſh is <hi>Imaginatio laeſa,</hi> you fancy yourſelf to be a very learned man; you pitty our ignorance, and are reſolued to reform the Roman Catholik Church, ſo horridly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac't with errours euer ſince Pope Gregory the 7. I will endeauour to correct this imagination of yours, by letting you ſee, that you are not right; that is, I will proue by one of Saint Auguſtins arguments (in the following Exhortation) that you are abſolutely mad. This is the only way to cure you, and to reconcile you to God, and his Church. I pray read theſe Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſions in one of your lucid interuals, and I hope (with the aſſiſtance of God) it will diſpoſe you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and retract your follies.</p>

               <head>A Charitable Exhortation to Friar Peter Walsh, taken out of S. Auguſtins works.</head>
               <p>MR. Walſh, the great Doctor of Gods Church S. Auguſtin (Ep. 118.) teacheth, that it is <hi>moſt inſolent madneſs to diſpute againſt that which the vniuerſal</hi> (or Catholik) <hi>Church practiſeth.</hi> Jf this be true it muſt be concluded, that you are fallen into that diſtemper, as I am almoſt in deſpair of your cure. For, one of the effects of madneſs, is, to depriue the diſtemper'd perſon ſo totaly of his wits, that he
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:40690:79"/>doth not perceiue his own follies. A weak or half wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man hath ſo much ſenſe left, as to ſee his own weakneſs and want of aduice, but a madman doth not ſee his own weakneſs, nor will he be aduiſed. This is your condition Mr. Walſh, and only God can remedy it, by opening your eyes to ſee how ridicul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us it is in you, or any other priuat perſon, to pretend and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the Church of God hath bin infected with <hi>the very higheſt enormities of principles and practiſes</hi> theſe 600. years; euer ſince Pope Gregory 7. Item that all the Roman Catholik Biſhops of the world are either Traytors to their temporal Soueraigns, or periur'd to their Spiritual Superior, the Pope, for taking before their conſecration an oath, which neuer was excepted againſt by any Soueraign Prince, or euen priuat perſon, but yourſelf. Certainly you are perſuaded that all Chriſtian Soueraigns, as well as their Miniſters of ſtate, and Councellors, for many ages were mad; ſeing they not only did not except againſt the Biſhops oath, but after the Biſhops had taken it, permitted them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the great reuenues of the Biſhopriks in their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, and truſted them with their conſciences and Councells, employing them in ſtate affairs, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſies, notwithſtanding their being Traytors, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iur'd perſons. Would any one but a mad man truſt a Traytor, or belieue a periur'd perſon?</p>
               <p>Mr. Walſh, when a man coms to be ſtark mad, he thinks all the world is mad, and that himſelf alone is wiſe. You are arriued to this perfection. All Soueraign Princes, all their Councellors, all their learned and loyal Subiects, are ſo notoriouſly mad (according to the beſt of your iudgment) as to put their neereſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns into the hands of Traytors, or periur'd Biſhops. Good God! How coms this to paſs? I confeſs our ſins are great, and deſerue the ſeuereſt puniſhments;
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:40690:80"/>but ſure Gods mercy would neuer inflict in this life a puniſhment of ſin, wherby is taken away the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of its repentance, and certainly mad men can not poſſibly repent. But how com you Mr. Walſh, to be the only man that eſcap't this ſad puniſhment? Are not you a ſinner like the reſt of the world? Are you the only man in Gods fauor, and in your wits? Alas! what an age is this? Nay what a world, what a Church is this? A Church, that for ſix entire Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries had not one ſober man but Peter Walſh? Peter Walſh! A man whom we all that knew him, took to be no better, nor wiſer, than ourſelues. But it ſeems we are all mad, and therfore can not frame a right iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either of him, or of ourſelues.</p>
               <p>But Mr. Walſh, Jf all the world beſides yourſelf is mad, how will you perſuade vs that you are ſober, and we all mad? For my own part, I declare before hand, I will not belieue you in this point, and I am conſident moſt men will be as obſtinat as I, in the good opinion they haue of themſelues. Remember I tell you, it will be a difficult thing to alter it. To what purpoſe then haue you taken the pains to write and print this volume? To perſuade people they are mad, and that their Predeceſſors haue bin ſo theſe 600. years paſt? Set your heart at reſt. None will belieue you. So farr perhaps we may agree with you, that either you, or we are mad. The queſtion then will be, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the Roman Catholik world, or you Mr. Walsh, be diſtracted? who shall be Iudge of this Controuerſy? Not the Pope, ſay you; for 80. of them in a row (euer ſince Gregory 7.) haue bin mad. Let that paſs; will you be iudg'd then by the Generall Councells of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran, Lions, Florence,</hi> or <hi>Trent?</hi> You can haue no other exception againſt them, but that euery member of them took the oath, which you ſay muſt needs make them
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:40690:80"/>Traitors, or periur'd perſons. I confeſs if the oath doth work that effect, your exception is rational, and all the Catholik world was mad in ſubmitting to the Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions and Decrees of thoſe Councills, and you are the only ſober man that hath liued in ſix ages.</p>
               <p>Without doubt theſe or the like obiections occurr to yourſelf, if you haue any lucid interualls. They occurr'd to all ſuch Reformers of the Catholik Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as you are. They occurr'd to Luther (whoſe <hi>Ape</hi> you are ſaid to be) when he writ, <hi>How often did my trembling heart beat within me, and reprehending me, obiect againſt me that moſt ſtrong argument; Art thou only wiſe. Do ſo many worlds err? Were ſo many ages ignorant? What if thou erreſt, and draweſt ſo many into error to be damned with thee eternally?</hi> And again. <hi>Doſt thou o ſole man, and of no account, take vpon thee ſo great matters?

                     </gap>e to err? Hitherto appertain thoſe arguments, the Church, the Church, the Fathers, the Fathers; the Councells, the cuſloms, the Multitudes, and greatneſs of wiſe men whom do not theſe clouds, and doubts, yea theſe ſeas of examples ouerwhelm?</hi> You ſee what lucid interualls and illuſtrations Luther had, I hope you haue the like ſomtimes. Theſe conſiderations will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly cure your moſt inſolent madneſs of diſputing againſt that which the vniuerſal Church belieueth and practiſeth, if you will entertain them.</p>
               <p>But if you will reiect them, and imitat Luther in preferring your own priuat ingment and interpretation of the Scriptures before that of the Church, theſe il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtrations and conſiderations will not cure your diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, nor correct your erroncous fancies. When a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing impreſſion doth ſtrike, or affect the brains, it ſinkes ſo deeply into them (eſpecialy if they be shallow) that the fancy which it begets, doth ſtick almoſt inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perably
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:40690:81"/>to the perſon pleaſed with it; and becomes a real perſuaſion, if the mans ſoul be ſo much a ſlaue to vanity and ſenſual pleaſures, as not to reiect thoſe, which are againſt reaſon. Its thought Mr. Walsh, by men whom we Catholiks take to be ſober and iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons, that this is your caſe. You are hugely pleaſed with the fancy and conceit you haue of your own abilities and wit, as being much more penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and your iudgment more profound, than that of other men; this fancy is ſo deeply rooted in your shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low brains, that you look vpon the reſt of the world as diſtracted perſons, when they contradict you. This fancy you preferr before all contrary euidences, which are as many as your errors. You are ſo beſotted with it, and with your own ſentiments, that you do not perceiue their non ſenſe and contradiction; in this condition you will continue (I feare) vntill you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue to be humble, and forſake thoſe pittifull plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which diuert your reaſon from correcting your foolish imaginations.</p>
               <p>Now that you know the cauſe of your diſtemper, though the cure muſt be miraculous, and proceed from Gods ſupernatural grace, yet tis (by his help) in your own power to obtain it, whenſoeuer, like the prodigal child, you will return to that mercifull Father, who with open arms expects you, and will meet you half way. Return therefore to your heauenly Father, to your holy Mother the Catholik Church, to your Seraphik Order of S. Francis, and to yourſelf. Return, I ſay, before you be preuented by approaching death, whoſe herbingers are already lodged in your diſeaſed body. Your dayes can not be many; let not that horrid euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting night and darkneſs oppreſs you at vnawares. Let not the terrible Iudge find you in <hi>flagranti.</hi> Burn your heretical bookes, that they may not increaſe the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:40690:81"/>flames, which otherwiſe will torment you in hell fit. Jn this world you can not expect any comfort, but that of an humble and contrite heart. Your Tenets, ſo inconſiſtent with the ſafety of Soueraigns, render you vncapable of being truſted or rewarded by your own, as your age doth of long enjoying preferment, if any should by miſtake be ſo mad as to moue for your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion. Though you had bin in the ſpring of your years yet the vncertainty of human life, and the length of eternity after it, would make your pleaſures very short and inconſiderable; how much more now, when you draw ſo neer your end. Jf the apprehended ſound and ſummons of the laſt dayes trumpet did keep Saint Hierom (when he was much yonger than you are) in ſuch awe, that he buried himſelf aliue in the Caue of Bethleem, to the end his mortified body might be glorified in the day of iudgment, with how much more reaſon ought it to terrify you, and make you retire to your religious Cell, and there chaſtiſe your pamperd body with the vſual diſciplines of your holy Order to prepare both for your particular iudgment (which is ſo neer at hand) and for the generall, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you will be publikly conuinc't of the falshood of your doctrin, and of the folly of your attempts. Let not the <hi>punctilio</hi> of miſtaken honor, nor the diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of a regular life, nor the pride of obſtinat here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, work more vpon your ambitious and diſcontented mind, than the example of Chriſts humility, or that of many greater wits than yours, who retracted their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and ſubmitted their iudgments to the Roman Catholik Church, in euery age ſince the Apoſtles. Take courage then Father Walsh, ſet on a braue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; God is at hand to comſort and help you; the Church militant prayes for you; the triumphant longs to reioyce at your conuerſion, which will be

For my own part, I shall commend your repentance more than I haue condemn'd your errors and in the mean time shall not ceaſe to offer my beſt deuotions that you may return to your wits and a virtuous regular life.</p>
